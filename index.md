# Welcome to my blog!

I love to write for myself, but 
I always keep *YOU*, my reader, 
in mind when I write. 
I think about what might be 
meaningful, 
what might entertaining, 
and what might be useful for you 
to read. My blog is a collection of my personal experience, my perpectives on various things career,
 my book recommendations, and more.

## Here is a list of my latest writing
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts reversed %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
#### Thank you, and hope you enjoy what I have to share! <3
