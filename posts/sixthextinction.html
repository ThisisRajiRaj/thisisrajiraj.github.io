<div className="blog-content">
	<div className="paragraph">When my husband takes out the trash, every now and then he surprises me by putting his
		hand deep into the trash bag. He proceeds to fish out a stray plastic bag that ended up there by mistake. I
		sometimes jokingly call him "the evangelical environmentalist". He spends an undue amount of time peeling paper
		<span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">off&nbsp;</span>&#8203;plastic bottles. Every other Indian immigrant I know
		comes back from visiting India with a suitcase full of snacks and spices. My husband recently came back with a
		suitcase full of plastic bottles that he couldn't find a way to recycle back home.<br><br><br>I have to admit
		that this inconvenient habit of his has caused me no small amount of consternation. And this has been especially
		true whenever I had something urgent to get done and he would sit there peeling tiny plastic stickers off fruits
		so he could compost their rinds. So when I read this book&nbsp; - <a

		made me understand a lot more clearly how much of a responsibility we all have to cut down our <a

	<div className="paragraph"><br><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">Elizabeth Kolbert, the author of the book, is a

				href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/prehistoric-world/mass-extinction/"
				target="_blank">five previous mass extinctions</a> and the theories behind them. These previous
			extinctions caused a sharp decline in the diversity of life on earth. Kolbert, using data and expert
			interviews, shows how we are heading toward the next mass extinction. One which is happening several
			magnitudes faster than the previous Big Five, thanks to the activities of "one weedy creature" - Homo
			Sapiens.</span><br><br><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">Kolbert's writing is fluid and fast. She mixes
			vivid storytelling with dry theories and data, and keeps the reader wanting to learn more. Whether she is
			describing her trek in the Amazon rainforests to look for army ants, or her night in a hammock listening to
			the mating call of tree frogs, or the rigor mortis of a thousand tiny bats lying dead on the floor in a cave
			in Vermont, she does it with clarity and energy.&nbsp;<br>&#8203;</span></div>

	<div className="paragraph"><br><br><br><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">Here are some curious as well as alarming
			new things I learned from the book.</span><br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>While massive catastrophes have come before, <strong>no creature has ever altered life on the planet as
					much as humans have</strong>. We have changed up to half of the planet's land surface. Our fisheries
				have removed more than a third of marine life in our oceans' coasts. We have used more than half of the
				planet's fresh water runoff. We have been instrumental in the expediting the "background extinction
				rate" of multiple organisms compared to&nbsp;the eras that came before us.</li>
			<li>Amphibians have been around for longer than mammals and since before dinosaurs. Today they are the most
				endangered class of animals. <strong>Show love to the frogs you encounter in your life.</strong></li>
			<li>Because of how connected we are, <strong>we - intentionally and otherwise - transport species around the
					globe</strong>. We load them onto boats, load them onto planes, and track them with us. This causes
				several unintended consequences including the native species not having evolved defenses to cope with
				the new organisms aka "the invaders" and the invaders - lacking their natural predators - overpopulating
				their new habitats. This is one way where we drastically impact the lives of other creatures that share
				the planet with us.</li>
			<li>Every day, <strong>a single American pumps seven pounds of carbon into the sea</strong>. It's similarly
				excessive in other parts of the world. Thanks to all this excess of carbon entering our oceans, oceans
				are getting acidified. This directly impacts the marine life, and stunts the construction of coral
				reefs. Coral reefs are nature's ingenious platforms to support a plethora of life in otherwise
				nutrient-poor waters of the tropics. At the current rate of carbon entering our oceans, <strong>one
					third of reef-building corals are headed&nbsp;toward oblivion</strong>.</li>
			<li>One popular theory is that Homo Sapiens obliterated the Neaderthals - the archaic humans.&nbsp;But there
				is evidence now that some of our ancestors mated with Neanderthals. <strong>About one to four percent of
					non-African human DNA is Neandarthal DNA.</strong> So, for many of us, it is hard to NOT be a
				Neandarthal after all!</li>
			<li>Just like our close cousins the Neadarthals, <strong>our other cousins - the non-human apes - are being
					driven to oblivion too</strong>. The number of chimpanzees in the wild has reduced 50% in the last
				fifty years alone. Lowland gorillas are disappearing faster than that. Causes include poaching, disease,
				and habitat loss.</li>
		</ul><br><br>We humans are one of the most evolved forms of life on the planet. We have the ability to cause
		huge amounts of destruction, knowingly and unknowingly. But we also have the capacity in our brains to reflect,
		to research, to empathize, to plan, and to course-correct. This world is a beautiful place teeming with a
		variety of interesting creatures. If we do not act now, we might be silently crushing that diversity and that
		beauty. But it's not too late to course correct. <a

			take your bags to the grocery store, eat more plants and fewer animals, buy local, and recycle. I can't
			believe I am saying this, but my husband is right. We need to take this issue VERY seriously and we need to
			do it NOW.</span></div>
