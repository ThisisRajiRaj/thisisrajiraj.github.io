    As 2020 dawned, I made a list of things I wanted to do this year.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Travel more
    </li>
    <li>
        Write more
    </li>
    <li>
        Read more
    </li>
    <li>
        Watch less TV
    </li>
    <li>
        Strength-train more at the gym
    </li>
    <li>
        &#8230;and so on.
    </li>
</ul>
<p> 
    No surprise, but only a few of those came true. 
    It was a case of the best laid plans of mice and men gone awry. 
    I did write more and read
    more. But traveling came to a screeching halt. There was little if any gym.
    And boy, did I binge-watch TV! All those episodes of The Crown and
    Unorthodox and the many, many late-night comedy shows were rivers of grain for my
    grindstone.
</p>

<h5>
    2020 has been a year like no other in my recent memory.
</h5>
<p>
    I remember the day when we first learnt that this year was going to be
    different. It was early March, a cool, overcast day in Seattle. There was a 
    sharp smell of fresh cut grass in the air. As I walked
    to my car at the end of a long workday, I looked at my phone, and there it
    was, at the top of my unread email - a message from our one of our VPs
    telling us to work from home until end of the month. All travel was
    suspended. My heart sank. I had a few trips and events I was looking forward to,
    including a keynote at a Codess event, and a visit to Lagos to see my team. I
    comforted myself that things will change soon, hopefully in April.
</p>
<p>
    April came and went. Dense morning fogs began to give way to watercolor blue skies.
    I continued to work hard to find answers the many new questions of our new
    reality. Should I work with my laptop, perched on my sofa, or should I pony
    up the money for a proper office setup? How do I deal with my now-constant
    neck pain? Should I turn on the camera when my home was a mess, and my hair
    was an even bigger mess? Should I exercise in the morning or the evening?
    Whose turn was it to cook lunch? Why were these so much dust on tables and 
    so many dishes in the sink? Should I buy more canned beans and soap? Should I be sanitizing
    the many cardboard boxes that got delivered from Amazon? Do I still fit
    into my jeans? How can I help my team feel connected and energized, when
    all around them was hardship, chaos, and unknowns? How can I make sure my
    75-year-old dad and my 81-year-old mother-in-law were safe and cared for?
    What happens if one of them falls sick and I can't travel?
</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    Slowly though, things started to fall into place.

<p>
    I started feeling less anxious. I created new routines for myself. I
    started running in the morning, meditating in the evening, bookending my
    workdays. I started clearing dishes in the sink after work, while listening
    to audiobooks. I checked in with my team regularly. I started talking to
    our parents every day instead of just the weekends. These habits and new
    routines began to help.
</p>
<p>
    I still missed seeing my people at work and traveling. But I started
    feeling less agitated about it all. I even began to appreciate the
    blessings this new reality bestowed on me. I don't have to spend so much time in
    traffic, feeling peeved about bad drivers. I don't have to attend Happy
    Hours where I pretended to enjoy the conversations when all I wanted to do
    was go home, get into my pajamas, listen to nothing but the low hum of my fridge, 
    and lose myself in a book. I had so much
    more time for connecting with my family, with my husband. I had so much
    more time for my books.
</p>
<p>
    Speaking of having copious time for books, I read a TON this year. 
    Most book readers love to recommend books to others, and I am no
    exception. So here is a list of books that I selected for you from the books I
    read in 2020 (with a few pictures of "my year in review"). You might have
    read some of these, and you might want to check out some others. If either of these is true, I'd love 
    to hear from you!

<h5>
    By far, the best book I read this year was Becoming by Michelle Obama.
</h5>
<p>
    Becoming is the story of Michelle Obama's growing up and her years in the
    White House. In it, we see Michelle, for the first time, as the human being
    that she is - her flaws, her anxieties, her strengths, and all. Not just
    the made-up character in her flowing gowns and J. Crew dresses, sometimes
    cast in unflattering light, and sometimes in glorifying light, by the
    media. In this book, she comes across as someone who has worked hard for
    her accomplishments, as someone who wants to make a difference in the
    world. I loved reading about her "box-checking", accomplishment-craving,
    perfectionist habits - habits that I battle with in myself.
</p>
<p>
    Here is a quote that I underlined in my copy of Becoming that REALLY speaks
    to me.
</p>
<p>    
    <div align="center" style="border-style:double;border-color:black;padding:10px">
        <blockquote>
            It wasn't pretty, but I found it encouraging in the end, proof that I could
    work my way out of just about any hole. Whatever deficits I might have
    arrived with, coming from an inner-city high school, it seemed that I could
    make up for them by putting in extra time, asking for help when I needed
    it, and learning to pace myself and not procrastinate.
        </blockquote>

<h5>
    I later read her husband's new book "A Promised Land".
</h5>
<p>
    Barack Obama's A Promised Land is a much more expansive, if a much less
    personal, book. His book is a telling of grand history by an ex-President
    of a powerful country. We get to learn about the inner workings of
    politics, the details behind how some consequential decisions (like the
    sanctions against Iran, signing of the ACA, repeal of don't-ask-don't-tell)
    got made. We travel with him to Copenhagen, Moscow, and Mumbai. We learn
    from the wisdom of W.E.B Du Bois, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. We
    begin to appreciate the immensity of the work in front of the leaders of
    powerful countries. For all its merits, though, the book is dense,
    wearying, and hard to keep your focus on. At times, it feels like a stump
    speech. You question the honesty of the writing. And at times, you wish
    that the editor had been more draconian and cut the prose in half.
</p>
<p>
    Michelle Obama's writing in Becoming, on the other hand, is intimate,
    crisp, honest, clear, and enjoyable - like a thick coat of melted butter on
    a piece of toast. Smooth, delicious, and decadent. I wish Michelle Obama
    would write another book - she is indeed a skilled writer!
</p>
<p>
    I know some of you will be taking time off work this month. Holidays are a
    time to reflect and recharge. What better way to recharge than with a good
    book? And if there is just one book you can read from now until the end of
    the year, I recommend Becoming by Michelle Obama. I hope you enjoy it.
