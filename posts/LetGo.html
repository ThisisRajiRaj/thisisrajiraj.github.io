  <p>"What is the worst that can happen if you let go?"</p>
  <p>
    A dear friend asked me this question as I was agonizing over an
    important career decision. We were standing in line to pick up lunch
    at a hole-in-the-wall Indian eatery. It was a breezy summer afternoon,
    and mouthwatering aromas of curries filled the place.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had just told her about a project that I had been working on for a
    few years. I had started working on the project with great enthusiasm.
    It had held much promise for the business and was terribly exciting.
    Over time though, it lost its luster. The business had moved on, and
    there were other more powerful opportunities to pursue. I had lost all
    passion for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, I did not stop working on it. Day after day, I endeavored.
    The more time I spent time on the project, the more disinterested I
    became and the more miserable I felt. And yet, I held on.
  </p>
  <p>
    This tendency to hold on - not give up or let go - is not new to me. I
    am a chronic serial finisher, and CANNOT give up easily. You may think
    that this is a good thing, and many times it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2002, I set my eyes on becoming a marathoner and signed up for the
    Seattle marathon. I put all my energy into it and trained hard. A
    month into my training, I developed stress fractures on both my legs
    and had to stop running. I couldn't get back to running for another
    two months. But then I did....and trained for the same marathon again,
    and - alas - got hurt again. I felt angry and dejected. I had failed
    before I even got to the start line. But giving up on the dream was
    not an option. I strengthened my resolve as I was nursing my injury.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally - after two mistrials - one July day in 2012, I did it. I
    completed my first marathon and I felt unparalleled joy and pride. I
    had got to the summit of my own Everest. This is still an
    accomplishment that I hold dear to my heart.
  </p>

  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It was a good thing I didn't give up on my dream of running marathons.
    However, there are many times this tendency to never, ever give up is
    not a good thing. For example:
  </p>
  <p>
    I finish every book I start no matter how miserable I feel reading it.
    The number of times I plod through books that evoke in me a keen sense
    of resentment for the author is countless.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hold on material things I buy long after they have lost their
    usefulness or beauty. At this point, they are just clutter that make
    me feel not so good about myself.
  </p>
  <p>I strive at projects that I do not have passion for anymore.</p>
  <p>
    But why do I do it? There are several explanations in behavioral
    science. Humans are generally loss-averse: the pain of losing
    something is twice as acute as the delight in gaining the same thing
    when you didn't possess it. We worry about a future where we do not
    have the thing we now have. This future is unknown, and humans fear
    the unknown. Giving up on something you have nourished for a while
    also evokes the discomfort of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy">
      sunk cost fallacy
    </a>
    . Abandoning after you have sunk time and effort into it feels
    wasteful.
  </p>
  <p>
    What we don't realize, though, is how loss aversion and holding on due
    to sunk cost are irrational behaviors. They are left-overs from our
    primal past, when small losses could mean huge catastrophes. It
    doesn't help us to make important life choices informed by that
    baggage.
  </p>
  <p>
    So how do we overcome these irrational behaviors and get ourselves to
    let go when necessary? Here is what I have tried that can help:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      First, mindfully evaluate the activity/relationship/thing you are
      having trouble letting go. When you bring it to mind, what do you
      feel? If you do not feel joy - and instead you have worry,
      resentment, boredom or any negative feeling - then set an intention
      to let go of it NOW.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask the question that my friend asked: what is the worst that can
      happen if you let go? Will it be a catastrophic loss you cannot
      recover from? More often than not, this is not true and you realize
      it as soon as you ask that question of yourself consciously.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask yourself: if you did not have it with you already, will you go
      and seek it now? If you will not, why are you keeping it?
    </li>
    <li>
      As you think about letting it go, acknowledge any emotions that come
      up. Fear of future, regret about the past, and anxiety are natural
      feelings that can arise, and it is ok for you to feel them. These
      will dissipate as you feel the freedom of letting go.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, just do the deed: let go.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Some things - like stopping to read a book you hate - may require less
    effort. Some things - like ending a joyless relationship or project -
    may take repeated reflection and meditation. It took a few mindful
    reflection sessions before I could stop working on my project, but I
    am happy to say that I did.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, I realized as I was talking to my friend that life is not
    a ledger to be filled with tick marks against goals and activities. No
    one is evaluating you for finishing everything you start, regardless
    how you feel. Life is meant to be lived well, happily and with
    meaning. If something you're holding on to goes against that rule, it
    is time to jettison it.
  </p>
  <p>Trust me - when you do, you'll feel free and joyous.</p>
