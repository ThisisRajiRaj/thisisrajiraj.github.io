			General&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricia-frost-508068156/" target="_blank"
				style="">Patricia Frost</a>, a retired US Army general, in a room full of Microsoft leaders last week.
			She and her team talked to us about leadership practices taught to West Point grads. They told us inspiring
			and fascinating stories about their various missions.<br><br>The stories were memorable. How could they not
			be? But the tools and practices that they gave us - as dry as they were - were memorable too in their own
			right. E.g.:</font>
		<ul style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75)">
			<li>
				<font size="5">Declaring a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intent_(military)"
						target="_blank">Leaders’ intent</a>&nbsp;can be as valuable for army missions as for creating
					clarity as a tech leader.</font>
			</li>
			<li>
				<font size="5">To "<span style="font-weight:600">Pause and zoom out</span>" when plans go awry is an
					excellent tactic in Software as well as in military missions.</font>
			</li>
			<li>
				<font size="5">The tool I loved the most is the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:600">Personal Leadership
						Philosophy (PLP) statement</span>. A PLP lets you reflect on, record, and communicate what you
					value most as a leader.</font>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<font size="5"> As we go from one decision to the next, often at a whirlwind pace, it is crucial for us to
			remember our values. If I value innovation but in the turbulence of everyday life I stick to the uncreative,
			I have not lived out my values. If I value truth, but prevaricate to my team, I have failed as a
			leader.<br>So after the class last Thursday, I couldn't wait for a few reflective moments to write my own
			philosophy of leadership.<br><br>Saturday morning dawned fresh and crisp. In the first moments of silence in
			my house, I took out my journal and started writing my PLP. It's not long, but it captures what leadership
			means to me. I see values like bold, accessible, respectful, and energizing. I have called out continuous
			learning as an important leadership value. I believe that, ultimately, a leader exists to further the
			potential of people around her using all the tools at her disposal. I am still iterating on my PLP (if you'd
			like to see it and give me feedback, please message me directly!)<br><br>So here is my question to you. Will
			this tool help you in leading people and your own life more intentionally? Would you like to write your
			philosophy of leadership?<br></font><br>
