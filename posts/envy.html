    <em>What is your first reaction when you hear that a friend or a colleague just got promoted?
    Do you instantly compare yourself to them? Do
    you feel an ugly sense of anger, shame, or disappointment with yourself?</em>
</p>
<p>
    This was the topic of a recent conversation. It was a stormy Friday evening in December. The
    wind outside was hurling rainwater at my windows. After a long
    week filled with meetings, I had one last one-on-one before 
my weekend. My one-on-one was with a young woman
    that I mentor at work, whom we shall call Ashley. Ashley had just heard that
    her friend - someone she had graduated with from college - was getting promoted
    to the Principal level at Microsoft. When she heard the news, Ashley mouthed words 
    of congrats to her friend. Then she quickly turned a glaring white spotlight on herself. She felt bad about her own
    progress and wondered why she was not as 
successful as her friend.
</p>
<p>
    As soon as she asked that question, she became suffused with unpleasant
    feelings. Her head clouded up, she lost interest in her work, and she even
    questioned if she belonged in this field at all. What began as a friendly
    conversation between her and her friend threatened to become a crisis in her career. 
    But Ashley was keen enough to notice her tobogganing descent
    into this unhappy place. She realized she had to stop the
    slide and stop feeling bad. That's when she called me.
</p>

<h4>
    Comparisons and envy come up a lot in my conversations, not just with 
    Ashley that day.
</h4>
<p>     
    There are, of course, 
    many nefarious reasons why some people - especially the ones that are quieter,  
    that are minorties in tech - can get recognized less than others. But Ashley was not there to 
    talk about these systemic issues in the 
    industry. She was also not talking about  
her own ambitions. Personal goals and ambitions, in my view, rarely have anything to do with comparisons with others. Ashley, instead, wanted to 
    talk about her state of mind. How she was 
    reacting to her friend's news and what she can do about it.
</p>
<p>Let's start by looking at why we compare and contrast our lives with others. 
    A lot of us in our industry have been schooled in competition and we revel in it. 
    Our schools graded us on
    a curve. Only one boy or girl could hold the highest rank in class. Our
    teachers pinned little stars in our notebooks when we did well. We got little
    trinkets to celebrate our excellence. There could only be one winner in most
    sports, and that winner got all the glory. Slowly, this engineering shaped
    us. 

</p>
<p>

<strong>Many of us have come to
    believe that external validation is what makes us worthy</strong>. We have come to crave the
    adult version of those stars and trinkets: promotions, compliments, awards, and material things. We compare constantly: is his child doing better than
    mine? Is she slimmer than me? Is he more liked? Does his car signal luxury
    more than mine? The list goes on. 
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Without a question, I've played this comparison game too, 
especially early on in my life.
</h4>
<p>We all have childhood stories that our families
    love to recount. One of mine happens to be the story of
    me, my brother, and a little cup of sweet, chocolatey Bournvita.

<p>Growing up,
    my brother was the "difficult" child in our household, and I was the "easy"
    one. Naturally, my mother spent more time doting on him, and naturally, I
    felt ignored. The story goes that I began to feel resentful and envious of
    my brother. One fine morning, when my brother was ten and I was four, I saw him
    nursing his chocolate drink in our dark living room, the steam rising to veil his face. 
    I toddled over to
    him, grabbed his drink, and tipped it straight on this head. It must have
    blanched his delicate skin. He jumped up, ran around the room like an
    excited dog, wailing and crying for our mom. Mom came running, and all I
    remember after that were the blows that rained hard on my back.
</p>
<p>
    In my later years too, I have compared myself to others. But I have also
    come to realize that envy is generally an unworthy, harmful, unproductive, irrational emotion.
</p>
<p>
    Let's think: how does envy REALLY help? There are emotions that can
    rattle you into action. When you feel angry, for example, you might be
    railing against an injustice that needs to be corrected. Your anger can
    spur you to do that. Love could be a compass pointing to safety, comfort,
    and other good things in life. But envy? It generally makes you feel bad
    about yourself and gets your blood pressure to rise. Your future actions
    get muddled and your hopes diminish. There are times when envy prompts you 
to evaluate your situation objectively and leave toxic 
ones, but more often than not, you are just paralyzed by the feeling.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    So how do you deal with this futile emotion?
</h4>
<p>
    Firstly, like Ashley did, <strong>become aware</strong> of what is going
    on inside you. Give yourself a time-out and go sit quietly with your breath.
    Maybe for ten minutes, maybe for twenty. Breathe in, breathe out, and
    watch the emotion spread in your mind like a drop of black ink spilled on
cream paper. Then <strong>reason over it</strong>. Tell 
    yourself why the comparison doesn't make any sense. Your journey in life is
    distinct and different from anyone else's. Comparing your journey to others' is
    as absurd as comparing Jane Eyre's life with Lisbeth Salander's. 
    There are things others have that you don't, and
    vice versa, and that is ok.  
    Feeling envy won't magically lift you up or make your suffering
    disappear. In fact, quite the opposite.
</p>
<p>
    Remind yourself that, regardless of what those stars and awards would have you believe, 
    <u>your value comes from within</u>.
    You're a valuable person no matter your status, the number of
    cars you own, the number of pearls in your jewel box, or the number of followers you have on social media.  
    You have talents and skills that you have developed over the years. You have battled
    hardships and won many victories against them. You do good work that makes you 
happy and proud. You try to be and ARE a good human. 
    <strong>Affirm to yourself</strong>: 
    <em>
        "I am enough; strong enough, smart enough, eloquent enough,
        interesting enough, clever enough. I am <u>enough</u>."
    </em>
    
    Finally, <strong>resolve to let the feeling go</strong>. But even after all this inner work, 
    the tendency to compare can be a stubborn customer. 
    Like me, you likely won't get it right 100% of the time, but you get better with practice.
</p>
<p>
    I listened to Ashley and told her that she was not a bad person for feeling
    the way she was feeling. It is only human to feel, and feelings come
    packaged like snack boxes. There are snacks in the box that are good for you 
    - like nuts and chocolates - and there are snacks you might do
    well to avoid - like hard candies and buttery cookies. The key is to
    distinguish them and attempt to subdue the ones that are destructive.
    Awareness, reasoning, affirmation, and letting go are steps that can help
    you with that.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    When I ended the call with Ashley, the storm outside had abated and a
    surreal quiet had descended on the streets. I knew Ashley was already on
    the first step to mastering her emotion. She had become aware of what she
    was feeling and why that was bad. Now onward to the next steps. I wished
    her luck and we said goodbye.
