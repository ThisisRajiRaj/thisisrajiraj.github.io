    <em>What is your first reaction when you hear that your friend, a peer, just got promoted?
    Do you often compare yourself to them? Do
    you feel an unbearable sense of anger, shame, or disappointment with yourself?</em>
</p>
<p>
    This was the topic of a recent conversation. It was a stormy Friday evening in December. The
    wind outside was hurling buckets of rainwater at my windows. After a long
    week filled with meetings, I had one last one-on-one before 
my weekend. My one-on-one was with a young woman
    that I mentor at work, whom we shall call Ashley. Ashley had just heard that
    her friend - someone she had graduated with from college - was getting promoted
    to the Principal level at Microsoft. When she heard the news, Ashley mouthed words 
    of congrats to her friend. Then she quickly turned a glaring white spotlight on herself. She felt bad about her own
    progress and wondered,
    why am I not as successful as him?
</p>
<p>
    As soon as she asked that question, she became suffused with unpleasant
    feelings. Her head clouded up, she lost interest in her work, and she even
    questioned if she belonged in this field at all. What began as a friendly
    conversation between her and her friend threatened to become a crisis in her career. 
    But Ashley was keen enough to notice her tobogganing descent
    into this unhappy place. She braked hard. She realized she had to stop the
    slide and stop feeling bad. That's when she called me.

    Comparisons and envy come up a lot in my conversations, not just with 
    Ashley that day.
</h5>
<p> 
    Many people compare themselves to their colleagues and judge their own career poorly in comparison. They ask themselves 
    what they are doing wrong. 
    There are, of course, 
    many nefarious reasons why some people - especially the ones that are more introverted,  
    that are minorties in tech - can get recognized less than others. But Ashley was not there to 
    talk about these systemic issues in the 
    industry. She was asking me a personal question about a personal problem. She wanted to 
    talk about her own state of mind. How she was 
    reacting to her friend's news and what she can do about it.
</p>
<p>Let's start by looking at why we compare and contrast our lives with others. 
    A lot of us in our industry have been schooled in competition and we revel in it. 
    Our schools graded us on
    a curve. Only one boy or girl could hold the highest rank in class. Our
    teachers pinned little stars in our notebooks when we did well. We got little
    trinkets to celebrate our excellence. There could only be one winner in most
    sports, and that winner got all the glory. Slowly, this engineering shaped
    us. 

</p>
<p>

Many of us have come to
    believe that external validation is what makes us worthy. We have come to crave the
    adult version of those stars and trinkets: promotions, kudos, awards, followers on
    social media, and so on. We feel a pang in our hearts when a friend buys a
    second house, and we are still living in a rental apartment. We compare constantly: is his child doing better than
    mine? Is she slimmer than me? Is he more liked? Does his car signal luxury
    more than mine? The list goes on.
</p>
<br/>
<h5>
    "Have you felt this way, comparing yourself to others?" Ashley asked me.
</h5>
<p>
    "Without a question," I replied. 
</p>
<p>We all have childhood stories that our families
    love to recount. My family loves to tell the story of
    me, my brother, and a little cup of Bournvita, a malted chocolate drink famous in India.

<p>Growing up,
    my brother was the "difficult" child in our household, and I was the "easy"
    one. Naturally, my mother spent more time doting on him, and naturally, I
    felt ignored. The story goes that I began to feel resentful and envious of
    my brother. One fine morning, when my brother was ten and I was four, I saw him
    nursing his chocolate drink in our dark living room, the steam rising to veil his face. 
    I toddled over to
    him, grabbed his drink, and tipped it straight on this head. It must have
    blanched his delicate skin. He jumped up, ran around the room like an
    excited dog, wailing and crying for our mom. Mom came running, and all I
    remember after that were the blows that rained hard on my back.
</p>
<p>
    In my later years too, I have compared myself to others. But I have also
    come to realize that envy is generally an unproductive, irrational emotion.
</p>
<p>
    Let's think: how does your envy REALLY help? There are emotions that can
    rattle you into action. When you feel angry, for example, you might be
    railing against an injustice that needs to be corrected. Your anger can
    spur you to do that. Love could be a compass pointing to safety, comfort,
    and other good things in life. But envy? It generally makes you feel bad
    about yourself and gets your blood pressure to rise. Your future actions
    get muddled and your hopes diminish. There are times when envy prompts you 
to evaluate your current team or company objectively and leave toxic 
situations, but more often than not, you are just paralyzed by the feeling.
</p>
<br/>
<h5>
    So how do I deal with this futile emotion?
</h5>
<p>
    Firstly, like Ashley did, I <strong>become aware</strong> of what is going
    on inside me. I give myself a time-out and go sit quietly with my breath.
    Maybe for ten minutes, maybe for twenty. I breathe in, breathe out, and
    watch the emotion spread in my mind like a drop of black ink spilled on
cream paper. Then I <strong>reason over it</strong>. I tell
    myself why the emotion doesn't make any sense. My journey in life is
    distinct and different from anyone else's. Comparing my journey to others' is
    as absurd as comparing Jane Eyre's life with Lisbeth Salander's. 
    There are things I have that others don't, and
    vice versa, and that is ok. I am running my own marathon. 
    Moreover, feeling envy won't magically lift me up or make my suffering
    disappear. In fact, quite the opposite.
</p>
<p>
    At this point, it also helps for me to remember where my value as a person
    comes from. Regardless of what those stars and awards would have me believe, 
    <u>my value comes from within</u>.
    I am a valuable person no matter my status, the number of
    cars I own, the number of pearls in my jewel box, or the number of friends I have. 
    I have talents that I have developed over the years. I have battled
    hardships and won many victories against them. I do good work that makes me 
happy and proud, and I learn every day. I have skills, knowledge,
    and abilities that I have used to help others. I try to be a good human. 
    I remind myself of all of that and <strong>affirm to myself</strong> that 
    <em>
        "I am enough; strong enough, smart enough, eloquent enough,
        interesting enough, clever enough. I am <u>enough</u>."
    </em>
    
    Finally, I <strong>resolve to let the feeling go</strong>. But even after all this inner work, 
    the tendency to compare can be a stubborn customer. 
    I don't get it right 100% of the time, but I try and I have tools in my arsenal to deal 
    with it.
</p>
<p>
    I listened to Ashley and told her that she was not a bad person for feeling
    the way she was feeling. It is only human to feel, and feelings come
    packaged like snack boxes. There are snacks in the box that are good for you 
    - like nuts and chocolates - and there are snacks you might do
    well to avoid - like hard candies and buttery cookies. The key is to
    distinguish them and attempt to subdue the ones that are destructive.
    Awareness, reasoning, affirmation, and letting go are steps that can help
    you with that.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    When I ended the call with Ashley, the storm outside had abated and a
    surreal quiet had descended on the streets. I knew Ashley was already on
    the first step to mastering her emotion. She had become aware of what she
    was feeling and why that was bad. Now onward to the next steps. I wished
    her luck and we said goodbye.
