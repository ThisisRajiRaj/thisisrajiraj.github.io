title: A bucket of opportunities
date: June 14, 2021
---
<p>
    My very first manager at Microsoft, Colin, gave me some advice that I'll
    never forget.
</p>
<p>
    It was my day two at the company. I walked into Colin's office for a
    one-on-one meeting. Among my first questions to him - how can I be
    successful in this company?
</p>
<p>
    He looked at me, took a breath, and then said these life-changing words.
</p>
<p>
    "Raji," he said, "whenever you walk into my office and ask me for an
    opportunity, I can give you one from this bucket I have."
    He mimed holding an invisible bucket in his right hand. "You see, this bucket has a few opportunities I have for 
    all my team. If you deliver on one with quality and on time, you'll do well.
</p>
<p>
    "But...what will really make you excel here is if <strong>you</strong> brought in
    an opportunity yourself AND delivered on it. Does that make sense?"
</p>
<p>
    I didn't fully get it then, but now I do. He wanted me to create new
    opportunities for myself and for the team. He wanted me to be inventive,
    creative. To give more than to take. He wanted me to help shape the future
    for us by actively scanning the horizon. That, in his view and now in mine,
    is required for doing outstanding work.
</p>
<p>
    Last week, I was sharing this advice with someone. She told me it is great
    advice, but where can she find these new opportunities? Are there some things she
    can do to be able to spot them in her horizon? 
</p>
<p>
    Here are a few tips that I have compiled for her, and for you.
</p>
<h5>
    1. Read widely
</h5>
<p>
    If there is a single habit that has helped me leaps and bounds, it is my
    habit of reading. I read because I enjoy reading. Reading happens to one of
    my <em>hygge </em>things to do. But reading has also enhanced my career in
    many ways. I routinely find new ideas in the books I read, whether it is
    around technology or software engineering or leadership or business.

<br/><br/>
<p>
    Pick up books on a wide range of subjects. Follow recommendations from
    folks you admire and leaders in your field. Reflect on your areas of strength and weakness and 
    target your reading toward both of them. Spend rainy afternoons in
    bookstores, libraries, or on online catalogs of books. Browse websites and
publications like <a href="https://hbr.org/">HBR</a>,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/">WSJ</a>,<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>,<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>,<a href="http://highscalability.com/">High Scalability</a>, and    <a href="https://techcrunch.com/">Tech Crunch</a>. You might be surprised
    by where you find that little diamond of information that is very
    relevant to your work.
</p>
<h5>
    2. Listen actively
</h5>
<p>
    It is important to be aware of what is going on in your organization,
    broadly if not deeply. One way to do that is to pay attention - REAL
    attention - to what people say in meetings, in conversations, and in
    emails. Be present in conversations. Be aware of your own reflexes - the
    reflex to think of your response before you fully grok what someone is
    saying, the reflex to quickly dispute a different perspective, the reflex
    to make assumptions - and challenge them. Focusing your mind becomes easier
    if you practice a
    <a href="https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/">
        contemplative practice
    </a>
    every day. Tune in using a technique like
    <a href="https://www.mindful.org/how-to-practice-mindful-listening/">
        HEAR
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    Being plugged in your organization can give you tremendous advantages.
</p>
<h5>
    3. Cut through the noise
</h5>
<p>
    According to this
    <a
        href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/?sh=39f072ab60ba"
    >
        Forbes
    </a>
    article, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data in a single day. That is
    an overwhelming amount of information and much of it is not going to help
    you with your next opportunity. How can you be effective in paying
    attention to the right things?

    Nancy Pearl, a Seattle-based librarian and bestselling author, has proposed
    "The Rule of 50" for dropping bad books, books that are not serving your
    time well. The idea is to give every book a small chance - no more than 50
    pages - to interest you. In software engineering terms, "fail fast" on the
    books you read. It takes roughly an hour to read fifty pages, and for most
    information that comes our way online - blog posts like this one,
    Reddit/Twitter threads, emails, and articles - an hour is a lot to give.
    I'd fail fast within two minutes for such things.
</p>
<p>
    This will help you save your most important resource - your attention - on
    things that matter the most.
</p>
<h5>
    4. Make connections
</h5>
<p>
    It is not enough to listen mindfully, absorb information from a variety of
    sources, and have an excellent ability to retain it all. You need to be
    able to make connections between what you learn and how it is applicable to
    your work. Making parallels between varied domains is a good path to
    innovation. You see/hear, understand, and reimagine ideas. This is called
    Analogical thinking and it is crucial for finding new opportunities.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "Modern life requires range, making connections across far-flung domains
    and ideas…Analogical thinking takes the new and makes it familiar, or takes
    the familiar and puts it in a new light, and allows humans to reason
    through problems they have never seen in unfamiliar contexts." - David
    Epstein, author of Range

<p>
    Many innovators and scientists have been known to do exactly that. In his
    book
    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M6QPRRG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"
    >
        Range
    </a>
    v, Epstein makes a case that having multiple careers and interests can give
    professionals more scope for such analogical thinking, resulting in better
    innovations.
</p>
<p>
    When you learn something new in a book or an article or a conversation with
    a colleague, think of the connections you can make to your own work. How
    can you apply it to something that can help your team or your customers?
</p>
<h5>
    5. Build relationships
</h5>
<p>
    I am a rank-and-file introvert. Given a choice, I'd rather stay in my
    large-sized recliner, a thick fleece blanket around my ankles, and my nose
    in my kindle, than meet new people. But I have come to realize that meeting
    new people can be both enjoyable and useful in my life and work. You can
    learn new things from people, learn more about how your work can help them
    or vice versa, and build relationships that can help build trust. What
    more, studies have shown that social connections can make you happier -
    even if you are an introvert.
</p>
<p>
    So these days, I have learned to allow new situations and new people to
    surprise me. I have put myself forward and done a little bit more of that
    dreaded "networking" than I'd naturally.
</p>
<h5>
    <strong>6. Raise your hand </strong>
</h5>
<p>
    Of course, my manager Colin's point was not that I should just come up with
    new opportunities for the team. That is just the first step. He was
    encouraging me to execute on these opportunities as well.
</p>
<p>
    When there is a new, exciting thing that comes your way, sign up for it.
    Raise your hand, even if you do not feel like you have everything figured
    out just yet. Trust that you will figure it out, with patience, time, and
    effort.
</p>
<p>
    Not all opportunities you think of will be celebrated by everyone around
    you. Some of them will turn out be gold, and some will be just dust. That's
    ok. The key is to keep hunting for new ways to shape the future.
</p>
<p>
    So, happy hunting, folks!
