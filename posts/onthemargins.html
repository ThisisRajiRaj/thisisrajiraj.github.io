    Their names were Yasmin and Fatima. Yasmin, the eldest, was fifteen years
    old. Fatima was fourteen. Their parents had rented a
    place out to my dad when he lived in a town called Salem. I was 
    living with my uncle and aunt at the time, and I visited Salem for the first time during my summer break of 1992, which
    was when I first met Yasmin and Fatima.
</p>

<p>
    The girls fascinated me. They had delicate skin, skin that turned pink like rose milk in the blistering Indian heat. They
    had lush curly hair and brilliant irises flecked with chestnut brown. 
    They were 
    self-assured, rich, elegant, and beautiful.
    I was slightly intimidated by them.
</p>
<p>
    But a bored teenager on a summer break, with no books to read, is no match for
    intimidation. One day, I worked up the courage to talk to them. We quickly
    became friends. Many afternoons that summer, I spent in their warm company.
    They told me all about the local customs, shared neighborhood gossip,
    complained about their parents, talked about boys. We ate roasted peanuts
    from paper cones, sitting with our legs folded beneath us. I was thrilled
    that they chose to be my friends, that they chose to
    share their stories with me. As the time came for me to leave Salem, I
    started feeling a pang in my heart. I knew I'd miss Yasmin and Fatima.
</p>
<p>
    A few days before I left, Fatima found me, alone on our common
    terrace, gathering the crackling hot clothes that had dried on our clothesline. 
</p>

<br/>

<h5>
    "My sister is going to get married," she said, without much ado.
</h5>
<p>
    I looked at her, confused. Yasmin was just 15-years old, a high schooler
    like me. Even though I had been brought up in a very traditional family
    myself, the fact didn't compute in my head. But Fatima didn't feel anything
    odd about the arrangement. She had come there to just tell me the news, not to bemoan what was happening.
</p>
<p>
    Later, my dad told me that it was not uncommon for "girls like Fatima and
    Yasmin" to get married before they finished school. By that he meant girls
    in small towns, girls with parents that kept the old ways of old religions,
    girls with parents that were not very educated themselves. In the case of
    Yasmin, her family just wanted her married before she became
    "unmarketable". Older, more educated girls were deemed more trouble, and
    therefore less desirable. A woman who worked not just took away a job that
    was rightfully a man's, but her character could be thrown into question
    too.

<br/>
<p>
    In the end, I didn't attend Yasmin's wedding. I had to leave Salem before
    then. But my dad told me that the wedding was a lavish affair. Yasmin
    sparkled with rows of gold necklaces around her neck. Over a thousand
    guests attended. Yasmin dropped out of school and was misty-eyed when she
    left her father's home, but she was happy. She had achieved one of the
    biggest goals that she had been trained to pursue: make yourself attractive
    enough for someone of good status to marry you. Yasmin and Fatima weren't
    encouraged to have dreams beyond that. Most of their lives, their work
    would be the traditional kind that goes unpaid: the work of a mother, the
    work of a homemaker, the work of a caretaker for the elderly.
</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    It was not just Yasmin and Fatima who left me with the nagging question,
    "But what about school/college?"
</h5>
<p>
    Before I was five, my mother had the habit of leaving me in the care of our
    servant Meenakshi, a skinny woman with a face that was shriveled like
    a dark raisin. Meenakshi lived in a shanty by a canal filled with flotsam. Her
    house had one room where her family slept, cooked, and bathed. I spent many
    an afternoon in her home, wrapped in the smells of onions and old oil.
    Meenakshi became like a mother to me. She often fed me Tamarind rice from her aluminum plate,
    mixing a spicy and tangy homemade paste with cold rice. She was a poor woman
    with a heart as large as the ocean.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
    Meenakshi had a 10-year daughter Lalli who played with me and told me stories
    while her mother cooked. Lalli never went to school, would never go to
    school in her life. Sometimes she would run her hands over my school books 
    wrapped in crisp, brown paper, and take a whiff of their insides, but she could not read 
    what was written in them.
    When Lalli was
    fifteen, she was sent off to be the live-in help for someone in Delhi. I
    never thought of it then, but have frequently done so after. 
</p>


<br/>
<p>    
    <div align="center" style="border-style:double;border-color:black;padding:10px">
        <blockquote>
            How could
            someone like Lalli escape the life she found herself in? How
            could she become someone who could go to school and then college and then
            off to a job that would pay her well?
        </blockquote>
    </div>
        
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    I was undoubtedly more privileged than Lalli. I was born into more money than her, a more dominant caste 
    than her, to parents with more education than hers. But I 
    had my struggles too. My folks liked to stay true to the old ways, and I had to argue for the many things that I wanted to do: to study, to study
    further, to have a career, and so on. In my family, women were always an
    afterthought. We ate after all the menfolk had finished eating. I washed my
    brother's and my dad's dinnerplates every day, clattering them over our stone sink.
    My brother was expected to do his homework in the evenings, whereas I was expected to
    help around the house - and only after that, do my homework. In college, I
    was told that I was wasting a "seat" that a boy deserved more. 
</p>
<p>But still, I had my guardian angels. My dad believed in my right to an
    education. He believed that I could make something of myself, besides being
    a mother and a wife. He stood by my side against everyone who questioned my
    right to be "so studious". One of my aunts - a role model - inspired me to
    pursue a career. We could afford books, notebooks, pens, and
    uniforms.
</p>
<p>
    Lalli didn't have any of that. Her family expected her to bring in money
    when she was just a child, not spend it on school and books. I could see how people like Lalli - 
    marginalized, mistreated, abandoned by society - could find it hard to escape
     the vicious vortex they were in. I could see how people like Yasmin didn't have
     role models of career women, or even people around them that encouraged them to pursue a career.
</p>
<p>
    I have lost touch with Lalli, Yasmin, and Fatima. Meenakshi is now dead. I
    look back on my friendship with them today because someone recently asked
    me why the work to lift up and include folks on the margin is <b>so important</b> to me. 
</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    Why do I feel strongly about the inclusion of people on the margins in our workplace?
</h5>

<br/>

<br/>
<p>
    Because I know that including everyone's potential in our workplace will
    make for more innovation and better products.
</p>
<p>
    Because I know that it is better for our economy to not leave hordes of
    people and their productivity out.
</p>
<p>
    Because I know that the world will be a better place to have everyone
    lifted.
</p>
<p>
    Because I know tech education empowers people, and
    empowered people can make big things happen for humanity.
</p>
<p>
    But more than any of that…I feel, in my bones, the struggles that people on the margins face. Girls that must defeat not
    just the voices of society, but their own inner voices, to be successful in
    male-dominated fields. Children that do not have the luxury of playing on
    their Xboxes or even using a computer in the evenings. Children that must work to fund not just
    their education, but that of their siblings too. Girls that are expected to get married when they are barely adults, and if they become
    professionals at all, it must have been after many pitched battles. Women like
    my own mother-in-law who, even though she was bringing in her fair share of
    her family's income, was
    expected to do 100% of the unpaid labor at home too. 

</p>
<p>
I know about the odds
            stacked against people like them, the people on the margins of our world. I
            know it is the morally right thing to do, to empower folks on the margins and make sure they have a seat at the table. 
One of the best humans that ever walked this earth, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, famously said this, and like many things 
she said, it makes a lot of sense.

<br/>
<p>
    People with privilege have a responsibility to 
help pull up a stepstool for the less privileged folks to stand on. I have been advised many times by well-wishers
not to take up the cause of women or
    other marginalized people. This advice often comes from a good place. My people 
    don't want me to suffer any adverse consequences at work because of any
    kind of crusade I might send myself on. But this is a cause that is important.
    Important to all of us because of all the reasons above, and important to
    me <u>deeply</u>, because of who I am, where I come from, and everything
    that has made me.
