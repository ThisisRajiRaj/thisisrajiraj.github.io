title: Don't see the sky through a straw, and other notes from the Juliana Trail

<h3 id="returning-to-words">Returning to Words</h3>
<p><span>There are seasons in life when we chase things. Sometimes it&rsquo;s wealth, especially when we&rsquo;re just
        starting out as adults. Sometimes it&rsquo;s recognition and accomplishment. But the chase that feels most
        meaningful to me is impact &mdash; creating something that leaves a trace of value behind.</span></p>
<p><span>For me, writing has always been part of that. Taking the swirl of thoughts and feelings inside me and shaping
        them into something that might matter to someone else. But when my dad passed away, that impulse dwindled. I
        kept writing in my journal, but the will to share disappeared. Words became private, hidden away.</span>
</p>
<p><span>A recent conversation reminded me how much words matter when they&rsquo;re shared. Stories, spoken or written,
        ripple outward and change things &mdash; they always have. That reminder struck a chord with me. So today,
        I&rsquo;m sharing again.</span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;m opening up my journal from a recent trip: the Juliana Trail.</span></p>

<p><span>The Juliana Trail is a multi-day hike around the Julian Alps in Slovenia (and a small portion of Italy). It is not a technical alpine trek. You don&rsquo;t summit many high peaks. Instead, it tests your endurance
        &mdash; long daily distances, climbs that burn your lungs, descents that test your balance, weather that turns
        in an instant. What it offers back is staggering beauty: emerald rivers, misty ridges, hilltop churches perched
        like brushstrokes in a painting.</span></p>
        <p><span>What follows are the raw notes I jotted down along the way. Not polished stories, but moments as they happened
        &mdash; tired, jetlagged, awestruck, frustrated, inspired. The trail didn&rsquo;t just take me through Slovenia;
        it took me deeper into clarity, calm, and lessons I don&rsquo;t want to forget.</span></p>

<h3 id="my-trail-notes">My Trail Notes</h3>

<p><strong><span>Aug 28, 2025</span></strong><span><br>And here we are &mdash; the trip I&rsquo;ve dreamed about all
        year. I wasn&rsquo;t sure it would actually happen in the past few weeks. First, I tripped while running and
        banged up my knee. My shoulder had already gone wonky after late night shifts with my multiple devices for a
        work conference. N [my partner] hurt himself strength training. We were both on physical therapy, slowly healing our
        bodies.</span></p>
<p><span>Then, my mother-in-law fell ill unexpectedly and unexplainably. We hovered, hoping she&rsquo;d recover (she
        did).</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, unanticipated changes at work I had to work through. Many conversations ensued.</span></p>
<p><span>But, I&rsquo;m here, finally, about to step into these precious days with the person I love most. If I
        don&rsquo;t stay present, these moments will slip through my fingers like water through a sieve.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p><strong><span>Aug 30, 2025</span></strong><span><br>Still jetlagged, still turning work over in my head. Only 5.5
        hours of sleep. Our bags with hiking poles and tripod are lost somewhere between airports. Zagreb feels
        nondescript, but last night we had a delicious vegan Lebanese dinner &mdash; spicy muhammara, Beiruti hummus,
        deep brown falafel &ndash; in a restaurant called Mezze. This morning we trudged through rain along cobblestones
        and tram tracks to the station. Bought donuts &ndash; one filled with fruit and another with Nutella &ndash; and
        boarded a train to Ljubljana.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Aug 31, 2025</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Ljubljana welcomed us with a pizza dinner (vegan cheese!) and a walk up to the castle. It was dusk. A Ragnar
        race was in full tilt. Runners were charging downhill like banshees. From the terrace, the view was dramatic. A
        brooding town under a dark, swollen cloud. Back at the hotel, we collapsed into happy sleep. This morning, I
        woke with a sore throat &mdash; nooo! Still no luggage either. But today, breakfast, then off to Kranjska Gora
        where the real trail begins.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sep 1, 2025</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The baggage saga is over. We got the bag delivered last night! Thank you, travel gods. Kranjska Gora is a tiny
        alpine town tucked below craggy peaks. A main drag with shops, caf&eacute;s, and a tourist office &mdash;
        that&rsquo;s it. We woke up to a pink sunrise glowing behind the mountains outside our windows.&nbsp;</span><span>The
        breakfast at the hotel was a great spread of breads and pastries and roasted veggies. A perfect start to our
        hike!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sep 2, 2025</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Second day done: nearly 24 miles behind us, 144 to go. We woke at 4 a.m. to beat the forecasted downpour.
        Breakfast was supermarket bread and spreads, plus excessively sweet vending-machine coffee. Thunder and
        lightning rattled as we ate, but the skies cleared as we set out. The climb was all mist and mood. But once we got
        near the summit, blue sky broke through. Almost no rain&hellip; until Jesenice. Then the skies ripped
        open.&nbsp;</span><span>We were grateful for our rain gear! Gingerly negotiating the rocky and rooty forest
        path, we arrived at Jesenice, sore and looking forward to better weather the next day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>PS: The hotel we are staying at today is owned by Alenka Durzon, an Olympic medalist at Alpine skiing in 1994!
        Wow.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sep 6, 2025</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Today is our &ldquo;rest day&rdquo;. We are staying in Bled and took a side trip in the morning to the stunning
        Vintgar Gorge. This gorge is quite popular and the boardwalks here can get jampacked with tourists. <span>We
            took the first shuttle there and had it nearly to ourselves. Just us, the roar of water, the mist in the
            air, and that impossible emerald green. Otherworldly. Later, naps, laundry, and strolling the lakefront.
            Bled is truly magical when the day-trippers leave &mdash; the lone island with its church, the red-roofed
            castle on the bluff, the plonk-plonk of pletna boats. A medieval painting come to life.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sep 7, 2025</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Stage 6: Goreljek na Pokljuki. Yesterday was rough &mdash; steep, eroded paths, no services, no water taps. We
        even got lost a few times before stumbling on a farm for water. Today, the walk down to Lake Bohinj, will be easier.
        Wednesday, though, will be brutal &mdash; rain forecast all day on a tricky, eroded stretch. I&rsquo;m already
        dreading it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sep 10, 2025</span></strong></p>
<p><span>S<span>tage 8, Podbrdo.&nbsp;</span>We don&rsquo;t like the apartment we have rented here. The bathroom is
        janky, the bedroom is noisy, and the light from the air conditioner kept us tossing and turning at night.
        <span>The walk here was a punishing climb and then a descent that shredded my nerves.</span> The first
        pitch after the summit &ndash; Vrh Bace &ndash; was on loosely packed dirt with no sure footing. But it soon got
        better<span>. Strangely, my feet felt worse on the flat walk to Bohinj than on yesterday&rsquo;s
            climb.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Tomorrow: rain. A Buddhist saying keeps circling my mind. <b>Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional.</b> If it
        rains, it rains.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sep 12, 2025</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Woke to passing rainshowers. They remind me how everything &mdash; setbacks, grief, loss &mdash; eventually
        passes</span><span>. Behind the dark clouds, the brilliant blue sky is always there above us.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Today we are walking from Most na Soci to Tolmin. The last three days were TOUGH. Exacerbated by bad weather,
        the path often felt treacherous. I am glad to have an easier day of walking today.</span></p>
<p><span>Stays on this trip have been a mixed bag. The last one, run by a kind woman, was a gem &mdash; vegan cheese and
        yogurt, loaves of bread, local honey, coconut cream for breakfast. This bungalow in Most na Soci though is rough and
        rustic. This trip is like a box of chocolates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sep 15, 2025</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I am sitting at a bus stop in Bovec and writing this on our way to Log pod Mangartom. We will likely be leaving
        the Soca river behind today. The beauty of this river will remain with me. It glitters teal green in the sun.
        It&rsquo;s wild, roaring, carving deep gorges where it goes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our path from Kobarid to Bovec was a testament to its sheer power. We lost our way again and again, partly due
        to the river having washed away sections of the trail. Nature is so beautiful here, and yet so brutal.</span>

<h3 id="life-lessons-from-the-trail">What I Learned Along the Way</h3>
<p>This trail - tough as it was - reminded me of some important truths about life. Gave me much needed mental space and clarity. Here are a few reminders that stood out.
</p>
<br/>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li><strong><span>You&rsquo;ll get wet anyway.</span></strong><span><br>On hot days, you&rsquo;re soaked in
                sweat. When the rain comes, you can&rsquo;t really outrun it. You pull on a jacket, cover your pack, and
                keep walking. At first it&rsquo;s irritating, then it fades away from consciousness. Some things
                    can&rsquo;t be avoided &mdash; they&rsquo;re just part of reality. Setbacks to overcome.
                    Progress happens when we move forward despite these setbacks.</span></li>
    </ol>
</div>

<br/>
<p>    
    <div align="center" style="border-style:double;border-color:black;padding:10px">
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                I never think, &ldquo;This is what I like, and this is what I don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; I think &ldquo;This is what it
    is, and this is what it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and whether or not I like it is really irrelevant, and I have extracted
    it out of my mind. - Richard Feynman
            </p>
            
        </blockquote>
    </div>
        
</p>

<ol start="2">
    <li><strong><span>The blue sky is always there</span></strong><span>.&nbsp;</span>

        <span><br />Clouds can cover the sky temporarily. Rain can dampen days. But it&rsquo;s important to remember
            that the blue sky is always there, behind those brooding clouds. Storms will pass. Perspective
                will return. You will see the eternally present blue sky again.</span>
    </li>
    <li><strong><span>What you dread is not what gets you.</span></strong><span><br>I braced for the rains, and I
            dreaded the long climbs. When these arrived, though, they weren&rsquo;t unmanageable. It wasn&rsquo;t the steepest
            hills or the darkest days that tested me most. It was the things I hadn&rsquo;t planned for &mdash; an
            unexpected eroded gully to traverse by an exposed canyon, endless road miles under heat, a sore throat I
            didn&rsquo;t expect. Fear often points us in the wrong direction. The real test is how you meet what
            actually shows up.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>You will get lost, and you will find your way again.</span></strong><span><br>The Juliana trail
            winds through forests, villages, and mountaintops. Signs sometimes vanish, GPS tracks are wrong, and you end
            up taking wrong turns. That&rsquo;s when you don&rsquo;t panic. You breathe, retrace, analyze, look again.
            And always, you find your way back. Getting lost isn&rsquo;t the end. You will find your way again. You have to trust yourself.</span>
    </li>
    <li><strong><span>Mistakes are teachers in disguise.</span></strong><span><br>On muddy descents, initially, I slid
            more times than I could count. My steps were clumsy, balance shaky, progress slow. But every slip taught me
            something &mdash; how to plant my feet, how to lean, how to trust the ground. After a few days of walking, I
            was falling less. As in many things in life, you are constantly learning by failing.&nbsp;&nbsp;You stumble,
            learn, adjust, improve.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>Freedom is not needing much.</span></strong><span><br>My whole world fit inside one backpack. A
            bed at the end of the day, a little food, a warm shower &mdash; that was enough. Life became stripped down
            to simple rhythms: wake, eat, walk. The trail peels away excess until you realize freedom isn&rsquo;t in
            having everything, but in needing very little.</span></li>
    <li>
        <strong><span>Don't see the sky through a straw.</span></strong><span><br>Sometimes, we get so focused on the
            immediate that we miss the bigger picture. On the trail, I had to remind myself to look up from my feet,
            breathe in the vastness, and see the sky above the mountains. In life too, it&rsquo;s easy to get caught up
            in details and miss the expansiveness and the abundance of this world. Step back, look up, and see the sky through wide-open
            eyes.</span>
    </li>
    <li><strong><span>In the end, it&rsquo;s the journey that matters.</span></strong><span><br>Reaching the end brought
            pride, but also a quiet sadness. Because the real joy was in the walking itself &mdash; watching the
            mountains shift in the light, feeling my body grow stronger, sharing the trail with strangers who became
            friends. Much as life itself, the destination is not the goal. The journey is the real gift.</span></li>
