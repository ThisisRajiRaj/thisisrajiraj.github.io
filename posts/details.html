    When I was a graduate student in Canada, I got very curious about the
    religions of the world. I explored the philosophies of many including
    Hinduism - the religion I was raised in - Christianity, Islam, and
    Buddhism. I picked up their ideas, held them up to light, and put aside the
    ones that did not make much sense to me. The concepts and practices of
    Buddhism in particular enthralled me. Meditation was an important practice
    in Buddhism and I wanted to understand it better. One day I decided to join
    a local community of Buddhist meditators.
</p>
<p>
    I began to drive daily to a dingy second floor apartment in East Vancouver,
    where about eight of us gathered to spend a few minutes in complete
    silence. We would kneel on soft off-white cushions placed against a wall covered with chipped cream paint.
    We would flutter our eyes half-shut at the clang of a gong and stay in
    stillness for twenty minutes. Then the gong would go off again, and we would
    get up and gather in the center of the room.
</p>
<p>
    The leader of the group would bring in a pot of hot jasmine tea along with
    eight little ceramic cups. In the silence of room, the clatter of the
    cups would echo. The
    leader would take up the pot from the floor and serve tea to her neighbor to the left. 
    The neighbor would accept the cup with a bow,
    place it down, take the pot herself, and serve <i>her</i> neighbor to the
    left. And on and on we went around the circle, filling tea for our
    neighbors and accepting our own cups with gratitude. When everyone's cup
    was filled, we would silently lift our cups to our lips and breathe in the
    delicate scent of jasmine. We would feel the heat seep from the liquid to
    the ceramic to our palms and notice the steam curl up in front of our faces. We would
    take tiny sips, all the while paying attention to nothing but the tea and
    how it warmed our bodies on those cold and clammy winter evenings in
    Vancouver. Someone would then read Buddhist scriptures, and the evening
    would end in a series of prostrations, bowing, and the circling of a statue of
    the Buddha, in synchrony.

    I was part of this meditation group for a single winter. There came a time
    when the ritualist aspects of the group started to rankle me, and I stopped
    going. Two aspects of that experience, however, stayed with me:
<p>
    1- I found the practice of meditation to be highly therapeutic and
    spiritual. I continued meditating at home - sans the circumnavigations of
    the statue - and still do so almost every day.
</p>
<p>
    2- Those tea sessions stayed with me. I was impressed by how much the
    practice stressed paying attention to the tiniest of details.
</p>
<p>
    The tea ceremony came back to my mind last weekend when I decided to go for
    a long walk in my neighborhood trail. I have run miles and miles on that
    trail for years now, and I had hardly registered the details on it. As I
    slowed down to a walk last weekend and forced myself to pay attention, my
    environment started to come alive. I saw the first cherry blossoms of the
    season, blooming in a riotous explosion of pink and white. I noticed the
    lime green weeds, grass, and moss growing with abandon on all surfaces
    including the muddy canal by the side of the trail. I heard the incessant
    warbling of songbirds and the tap-tap-tap of a lone woodpecker.

    These details had however become a blurry backdrop to my daily runs.
</p>
<p>
    It is so with many other things in life too.
</p>
<p>
    We often move too fast through our activities - our dinners, our commutes,
    our work, our conversations with our loved ones - for us notice much of
    what's going on. We move from pillar to post, scarcely paying attention.
</p>
<p>
    But paying attention is important. 
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Details are important.
</h4>

<br/>
<p>
    <strong>Details add color and wonder to our lives.</strong> After a long day of humdrum, have you ever looked up at the sky at dusk
    and been overwhelmed by the flamboyant reds of the sunset? Have you looked
    at a newborn child's tiny toes curl in on themselves and marveled at how
    this new life is here now when it was nothingness before? Noticing these
    tiny details about life and nature gives us a sense of wonder. It makes us
    realize what a fabulous thing life is. Without these astonishing details,
    our days can run on, one into another. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Details make us better at work and life. </strong>
    If you are a programmer, you should care about your craft deeply. Paying
    attention to every single line of code and how well they come together can
    help you write better code. If you want to be a good leader for your team,
    you should pay attention to every single person on the team - to what
    excites them, what brings them down, and how they are feeling. If you want
    to be a good partner or a good parent, you should keenly listen to your
    loved ones and care about the smallest details of their lives. Details can
    make an explosive difference to the quality of your work and life. Steve
    Jobs is reputed to have obsessed over the tiniest details of the products
    Apple shipped. He cared about even the parts that a customer could not see.
    He agonized over the exact shade of yellow on the Google logo as seen on an
    iPhone. There are music composers, painters, sculptors, chefs, and fashion
    designers that are legendary for their attention to detail.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Details make us happy. </strong>
    Caught up in ourselves and our anxieties, we can often become
    pre-occupied and unhappy. We brood about the past or worry about the
    future. We become self-absorbed. But if we stopped and paid attention to
    the present moment - to how the winter air feels sharp on our skin or how the
    cool of the water is refreshing on a hot summer day - we can get out of our
    own heads. Getting out of our heads is a good first step to happiness.

    It is a myth that greatness is in the big things - in monumental discoveries,
    audacious projects, and thrilling adventures. In our
    raucous modern world, the quiet whisper of minutiae feels unglamourous and
    uncool. But it is in these details that success and happiness lie. 
</p>
<p>
  So next
    time you have dinner with someone, instead of wolfing it down in front of the TV, 
  slow down and pay attention to the flavors and to your partner. When you are
    writing a document for work, pause - perhaps even move to a
    different task altogether before you come back - and then reread what you
    have written. Carefully look over the details and make sure the text will
    make sense to the intended audience. If you are out on a walk at twilight,
    gaze at the black sky and the breathe in the air. I bet that your happiness,
    the quality of your work, and the joy in your life will multiply. It is in
    details that we find the stuff of life and beauty.
