			<font>Sometimes, especially when you're new to something, you might feel like you're always getting it
				wrong, you’re just not good as the rest of them...the ones that are already successful or <strong>sure
					to be successful </strong>because they are <strong>talented</strong>. I want to tell you, my friend,
				that THAT is simply not true. </font>
		</span><br><br><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">
			<font>&#8203;To be talented - according to the Oxford dictionary - is to be gifted. To have a natural skill
				at something. Natural, magical, innate gifts are rarely required for "success".</font>
		</span><br><br><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)">
			<font>Let me give you a couple of examples from my own life.</font>
		</span><br><br>
		<font>In my day job, I lead an engineering team at Microsoft. In the evenings and weekends, I write. I run
			almost every day. &#8203;In all these aspects of my life, the story has been the same. I was not very good
			at them when I started. My growth has almost always come with pain and a LOT of
			effort.<br><strong>&#8203;<br>Exhibit A: Let us look at one of my early code reviews</strong></font>

		<font>Yes, those were forty-three comments from a single code reviewer for a single code checkin I wanted to
			make.<br><br>Such crushing code reviews were not infrequent early in my career as a programmer.&nbsp;I was
			never that genius, "natural programmer" who always wrote flawless code. It took me a lot of on-the-job
			learning to do my job well. Gradually, I made fewer mistakes. I started being recognized by my peers as a
			good dev.<br><br>&#8203;How long did it for me take to get to that point? &#8203;People talk about the
			"10000 hours of practice rule". In my experience, it is more than just the number of hours you put in.
			I&nbsp;<a href="https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory" target="_blank">practiced
				deliberately</a>. I reflected constantly on what was not working, how I could leverage my strengths
			better, and how I could learn from feedback. Any success I got, I would argue, came from these. NOT from
			being born with a flair for coding.</font>

	<div className="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">
		<font>&#8203;&#8203;<br><strong>Exhibit B: Let us look at my first attempts at writing for
				public&#8203;<br>&#8203;</strong><br>Has this happened to you? You read something that you wrote years
			ago, watch/listen to a recording of your speech from way back when, and you CRIIIIIINGGGGE! It happens to me
			a LOT. Case in point: my <a href="http://rajisramblings.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> from an
			earlier time in my life.<br>&#8203;<br>You need to write EVERY SINGLE day for writing to “come naturally” to
			you. Even when you write every single day, you could still get stuck. You could still face a lot of
			rejection, disappointing silence, and disheartening responses when you try to get published.<br>&#8203;

		<font>Sometimes, despite the effort, you might still feel like you have not "arrived". For instance I still feel
			quite average as a writer, as a speaker, as a photographer - you name it. You perhaps will never "arrive" in
			some cases. I imagine I will never run a 4-minute mile in my life. It's just not in my genes.<br><br>For
			most activities, though, effort pays off. <span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">People who appear "arrived"
				have likely put in that effort and paid their dues.&nbsp;</span>My reminder to you, dear reader, is
			this: if you feel like you're not talented at something or are currently struggling with it, please DO NOT
			give up. You'll get better if you stick with it and practice, practice, practice!<br></font><br>
