    Ok, confession time. I have not told this story to many people, so as I
    type these words, I am a bit nervous. This happened a long
    time ago. I tell you this story today because I think there are some
    lessons in it worth sharing. 
</p>
<p>
    
    Let me take you back to a time when I was a teenager. I lived with my
    father and my grandmother in a village in Tamil Nadu. It was a small
    village, and we all knew each other. One hot summer weekend that year, 
    news came to us that an acquaintance - a man who lived in a different town -
    had started producing miracles. Yes, you
    heard that right. This man, a human who went to work and ate from stainless
    steel plates like the rest of us, had started performing miracles for his
    community. He had started worshipping a godman - a <em>Guru</em> - a few years back.
    With years of prayer and piety, he now supposedly had supernatural powers.
    Holy Ash was materializing out of the paintings of various gods in his
    prayer room. Ash that had miraculous healing properties. Crowds thronged to
    his house. People started falling at his feet, heck, worshipping him.
</p>
<p>
    When the news of our acquaintance's miracle came to us, my father heard it
    and moved on. My grandma did the same. I, however, was disturbed. I had
    always let skepticism and curiosity whisper in my head like a hissing snake
    and make me do things that I'd later be scolded for. This time was no
    different. How could Holy Ash appear out of thin air, I pondered. Was it
    even real or supernatural? Is it possible that our acquaintance was making
    it happen? A part of my mind answered yes. I wanted to test the theory. I
    wanted to prove - or disprove - to myself that someone can engineer a
    miracle that many people will come to believe in.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>
    I had a plan.
</h4>
<p>
    The next day, I woke up at 4AM, when the rest of the house slept. I padded
    over in the inky darkness of the house to our prayer room. Every Indian
    household I knew had a prayer room, complete with a supply of Holy Ash and
    Vermillion that we used as talismans daily. I entered ours.
    The room smelt of old oil, rotting flowers, and burnt
    incense. I opened our Holy Ash container, took a generous pinch of it, and
    splashed it on the painting of Lord Ganesha. I then opened the container of
    Vermillion, and splashed it on the picture of Goddess Durga, the
    goddess of courage. I surveyed my handiwork with satisfaction and left the
    room quietly.
</p>

<br/><br/>
<p>
    The household stirred after an hour. The first person to notice the
    "miracle" in our prayer room was my grandma. She ran out of the room and
    dragged me in. She pointed to the ash and the vermilion. "Do you see it?"
    she asked, "God is visiting us too." She was genuinely moved.
</p>
<p>
    Before the sun was high in the sky, and the worst of the heat started, the
    entire neighborhood had heard of our miracle. That evening, there was a
    line of people waiting to see the Holy Ash. Their reverence for my grandma
    became worship. My grandma was over the moon, not just by the godly
    validation of her religiosity, but by the attention and status it brought
    her. As I watched the procession of people into my house that evening, with
    my homework notebook open on my lap, I knew I had to continue my
    experiment. Fake ash can fool people once, but can it fool them again? I
    had to find out.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Over the next week, I continued my experiment.
</h4>
<p>
    I continued sprinkling Holy Ash and Vermilion, making people believe that
    our house was specially blessed by the gods. No one seemed to question the
    veracity of it. I realized that I could continue this, possibly for a long
    time. That was when the guilt began. Having validated my theory, the thrill
    of the experiment subsided. I started to worry that what I was doing was
    not right. Religion mattered to our people in a way that few other things
    did. I really should stop it, I told myself.
</p>
<p>
    It took me another week to stop my miracle-making. I didn't want to end it
    abruptly, so I phased it out. My grandma was disappointed when ash stopped
    appearing in our prayer room. Crowds at our house dwindled. Things went
    back to normal. The episode became a family legend.
</p>
<p>
    As I reflect on that episode now, I realize it taught me two important
    lessons.
</p>

<h4>
    Humans are keen to create and believe in our stories.

<p>
    When something is too hard to comprehend, we resort to improbable
    explanations like divine interventions and magical occurrences. The unknown
    scares us, while such explanations comfort us.
</p>
<p>
    The universe is complex, and we have just scratched the surface of
    knowing everything there is to know about it. When something comes into our
    consciousness that doesn't compute, the simplest thing is to ascribe it to
    a simplistic, unfalsifiable explanation like an unknowable God. As tempting
    as it is to accept this Occam's razor, it is important for us to resist it.
    Not only do such explanations take us away from truth, but they make us
    more gullible and more exploitable to people with their own agendas. 
    
</p>
<div style="border-style:double;border-color:black;padding:10px">
    <blockquote>
<p>
   
    We should continue to look for reasonable explanations. We
    should teach our kids to think and question critically. We should teach
    them, and ourselves, to look for data, causal links, and theories that can
    be verified. This, I have come to believe, is one of best ways to keep
    pushing humanity forward.
</p>

<h4>
    Not being true to yourself and to others is a recipe for unhappiness.
</h4>
<p>
    The sole focus of my little experiment was to prove a point to myself. But
    the unintended consequence of it was that dozens of people believed wrongly
    that there was a miracle happening at my house. I had, effectively, misled
    them with little effort. My theory was proven right.
</p>
<p>
    That fact, however, didn't bring me happiness. In fact, quite the opposite.
    The adrenaline rush faded quickly, and I was left with a guilt that gnawed
    at my innards like a hungry wolf. It took me a while to shake off the
    guilt. But just as a child that learns to not poke her finger in a vat of
    boiling milk, I learned that misleading others, even for an innocuous
    purpose and even if it doesn't harm anyone visibly, brings you no small
    amount of angst. You can argue I was doing that in service of truth, but 
    in the process, I was not acting true.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes we betray truth without thinking that we
    are doing so. We do it whenever we pretend to be someone we are not, to be
    more liked or more successful. We do it when we profess a passion, a love,
    or an interest that we do not have. The lesson from my little
    miracle-making experiment applies in that case too. Not being true to
    yourself or to others may help you achieve your short-term goal, but in the
    long run, you will hurt yourself.
</p>
<p>
    Use scientific thinking to seek truth. As you do that, be true
    to yourself and to others. As Polonius said to Hamlet:
</p>

<div style="border-style:double;border-color:black;padding:10px">
    <blockquote>
<p>
    "This above all: to thine own self be true
</p>
<p>
    And it must follow, as the night the day
</p>
<p>
    Thou canst not then be false to any man."
</p>
