<p>
    I get it, you're disappointed. This year has been horrendous. And when it
    was not horrendous, it was boring as a beige wall. You deserved some riveting entertainment for your Christmas break. When
    you started watching Wonder Woman 84, you were full of hope and
    expectations. And yet the movie failed to deliver. The pacing felt jittery.
    There was too much stuff happening and yet not enough. 
    You felt the story was needlessly soapy about love. Major plot points
    were inexplicable. Yup, I get the
    disappointment that has been unfurled, like a red carpet, on social media.
</p>
<p>
    And despite all that, I found myself spellbound by the movie. Right from the opening
    scene when an astonishingly self-confident young Diana Prince, a little girl with plump cheeks, sprints
    across the green mountains of her home country, past susurrant waterfalls,
    to compete with women twice her age, I was all in. Hans Zimmer's music got
    my heart to soar. The action made me feel warm all over, smiling and
    clapping.
</p>

<p>
    I felt pure joy whenever Diana transformed into Wonder Woman, twirling her
    golden lasso, and moving as fast as a bullet. Yes, I too found the plot
    sagging and confusing in places. But overall, I enjoyed the movie and picked up a few lessons
    that are 
    valuable for both my work and life. Here are five of them.

<h5>
    1. Check your thirst for more. Think hard about what you wish for. Think
    hard about what you're giving up in return.
</h5>
<p>
    It is the classic tale of greed gone awry. We have seen it in other old
    stories. A Faustian bargain where what is given up is more valuable than
    what is acquired, even though the person making the bargain doesn't know
    that until too late. Midas' wish to turn everything he touches to gold nearly starves
    him to death. Dorian Gray's longing for eternal youth leads him to lies and
    murder. This is the central moral of WW84, and one that cannot be more
    relevant to us in our corporate world. As professionals, we can become
    inveterate box-checkers. Buy a home. Check. Get promoted at work. Check. 
    Get another home. Check. Get promoted again. Check.
    Get your first million. Check. Get another
    million. Check. Though some of this ambition is healthy, it never stops.
    The hunger for more intensifies and can lead you down some unhappy paths.
    We need to pause and think about what we long for and what we're giving up in
    return in this bargain.
</p>
<br/>
<h5>
    2. Empathy is essential.
</h5>

<p>
    In most superhero movies I watch, heroes embody pure good and villains
    embody pure evil. There are few nuances and few attempts made to humanize
    these black and white caricatures. In WW84, we learn a lot about the back
    story of Diana Prince. She becomes a superhero by learning in tough
    Amazonian wargames and training grounds. We see her disappointments and
    failures strengthen her. But we also see the villain Max Lord abused by his
    father and endlessly feeling unworthy of being loved. 
    We see the villain Cheetah simper nervously as an insecure nerd, craving being "more than nothing".
    The lived experiences of our villains, just like those of our hero, make
    them who they are. We judge our villains less viciously once we learn what
    their beginnings were like.
</p>
<p>
    In our work and life, we often come across people that strike us as
    difficult or even evil. But we rarely think about their back stories. I
    love that WW84 shows us that we should be empathetic to not just likeable people but 
    unlikeable ones as well.
</p>
<br/>
<h5>
    3. Do not be in a rush to "become great".
</h5>

<br/>

<br/>
<p>
    All too often, in our rushed world, we can't wait to be great. Not just be
    great, but also be recognized as great. But as Antiope warns Diana in the
    opening scene, this haste doesn't result in excellence. You need to pace
    yourself, set expectations in your head right, listen, learn, be patient,
    and progress. Becoming outstanding at anything - whether it is stopping
    tanks with your bare feet or becoming an admired developer at a software
    company or a mellifluous singer at the Metropolitan Opera - is a process
    and takes time. Bide your time, and do not be in a rush.
</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    4. Show resolve to make hard choices in life, even if your heart
    bleeds.
</h5>
<p>
    Doing the right thing, sometimes, can be like running up a steep mountain
    in biting wintry air in the indigo dark of dawn. Uncomfortable, and you
    really REALLY do not want to do it. You would rather stay warm in your bed,
    tucking your blanket around your toes. And yet, you may need to steel your
    heart and get that run in. In life, such resolve is what will make you
    great at what you do. When Diana makes her tough choice in the movie, we
    feel her heart collapse in her chest. But she walks away resolved to move on
    and face her next steps. That resolve, my friends, is a superpower.
</p>


<br/>
<h5>
    5. Be true to yourself.
</h5>

<p>
    It is better to live in a disappointing truth than a pleasing lie. 
    In the movie Matrix, Neo is offered a choice between a Red Pill and a Blue Pill. The
    Red Pill will cause him to face a reality that is unpleasant, and the Blue
    Pill will let him live swimmingly in a blissful make-believe world. Neo
    chooses the Red Pill. The Truth. Likewise, the Wonder Woman in WW84 urges
    us to choose Truth. The mirages of wealth, power, fame, and so on can be
    irresistible, but Truth is what will save your humanity, the movie argues.
    What is <u>your</u> truth?  What will your life be like if 
    no one was watching? Who are you, genuinely? Who do
    you want to be? Not who you are for the sake of all the mirages in your life, but who do you 
    <u>really</u> want to be? These are all wonderful questions for us to answer as
    professionals.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
    I loved WW84 for all these lessons. Unlike other superhero movies, it made
    me reflect on work and life. Unlike other superhero movies, too, the hero
    doesn't just beat up people because she can. She carefully
    picks apart the innocent people from the guilty ones, and avoids punishing the
    innocent. Such thoughtfulness in the middle of crises is something every
    leader needs to show.
</p>
<p>
    I know the reviews for the movie have been largely atrocious. But,
    personally, I believe I have found a new Christmas tradition.
