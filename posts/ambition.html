    I relish my philosophical conversations with my father. They give me a kind
    of perspective that I often need. My dad quotes to me wisdom from the
    Bhagavad Gita, Shakespeare, Dale Carnegie, Mahatma Gandhi,
    and many others. In return, I tell him about the new things I learn from
    the books I read, and my experiences at work: topics ranging from
    neuroscience to leadership to human behavior to meaning in life.
</p>
<p>
    Last week our conversation revolved around the perpetual dissatisfaction I
    feel with myself and my life. I told him how, no matter what I goals I set
    for myself and how much success I have in achieving them, my heart is
    always tinged with dissatisfaction. Here I am, sitting in a spacious home
    with a partner that loves me, with no worry about where the next meal is
    coming from, in generally good health, working for a company that I truly
    believe in&#8230;and yet I don't feel satisfied with my life. "Why is that?
    And what should I do?" I asked.
</p>
<p>
    I am grateful that my dad didn't just dismiss that as whining. "You and
    your first world problems," he could have mocked. Or said, "Stop
    overthinking and appreciate your blessings". But he didn't. He listened to
me patiently. Then he said that I feel dissatisfied because    <em>that is how humans are supposed to be</em>. Just because we had a
    wonderful breakfast doesn't mean we stop eating. We feel hungry at night,
    and we feel hungry again the next day. The constant craving and reaching
    for things will always be there.

<div style="border-style:double;border-color:black;padding:10px;;">
    <p className="pb-3">"If you stop reaching for things," he
    said, "if you stop dreaming about your next goal, your next challenge, that
    is when you stop living."
</p>
</div>
<br/>
<p>
    That is a spectacular statement to make.
</p>

<div style="text-indent:50px">
    <em>
    <p>
        Yes, you will always feel dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes, you will crave the next pleasure almost as soon as the previous
        pleasure fades from memory&#8230;which will be sooner than you think.
    </p>
    <p>
        But no, you can't stop the striving just because you know the
        dissatisfaction is just around the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because if you stop, you stop living
    </p>

    It's no surprise that my dad has that view. Let me tell you a bit about him. 
    I know fully well that I am not going to do
    justice to a man whom I consider one of my biggest role models, whom I love
    and respect and admire, by shrinking his life into just a few paragraphs.
    But I know that your time is limited, so I will give you a
    blazingly quick summary.
</p>

<br/><br/>
<h4>
    Imagine my dad as a scrawny boy growing up in the 50s and 60s in South
    India.
</h4>

<p>
    In the traditional Indian style, he lived with his extended family in his
    uncle's home. His uncle was the patriarch, and my father craved his
    attention and love. His own father was a weak, shadowy presence in his
    life. What were some things my father loved as a boy? He loved playing
    cricket with his friends. He loved his mother and his siblings. He loved
    the English language. From his mentors, he borrowed copies of Shakespeare,
    Wordsworth, and Thomas Hardy - not to read and enjoy the story, but to
    learn new words. In general, he loved standing out and being EXCELLENT. He
    entered every competition in his school. Even singing contests, never mind
    that my dad could hold a tune like a sieve could hold water.
</p>
<p>
    When he was twenty, he found a job as a cashier in a big, nationalized
    bank. The yearning in his heart to be loved, to be recognized, to be
    EXCELLENT, would take him from that entry-level job to a very influential
    position in the thirty odd years he worked in the bank. A few years in, when he was thirty-seven, 
    he lost his wife. 
    His twelve-year old son became a handful emotionally. 
    He had to find help to raise a five-year old daughter - me - who quite
    frankly didn't know how to react to losing a parent. He managed a million
    money problems we faced. He handled moving his family from one town to
    another, wherever his job required him to go. All this while, he continued
    educating himself and trying new things. 
</p>
<p>
    He would wake up at 4am and write
    poems in Tamil, and essays in English. He would try to publish stories in 
    magazines. He would read books, lots of them.
    My father, whom I came to know as the poet, the writer,
    the leader, the banker, the striver!
</p>
<p>
    Striving was my dad's constant condition. He strived to better himself
    every day. He strived to get a more influential position in his bank. He
    strived to raise kids who could become learned, talented, respected, and
    successful.
</p>
<p>
    Given that, it is not surprising my father finds ambition and drive in life
    to be as essential as breathing and blinking. But is my dad right? Do we
    stop living once we stop striving?
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Let me give you another example from my family.
</h4>
<br/><br/>
<img className="pb-5" src="https://thisisrajiraj.github.io/posts/images/quiet.jpg" />
<br/><br/>
<p>
    My father's cousin, the son of the patriarch uncle of my father. My uncle
    grew up in a small town in South India called Kumbakonam. The town is
    renowned for its adherence to orthodox ways of living and its hundred
    temples. It is quiet and laid back - a serene place to make a life for
    yourself. Like my father, my uncle found a job as a teller in a bank. But
    unlike my father, he decided early on that ambition was NOT for him. He
    didn't want to be buffeted from one town to the next, which was de rigueur
    in a bank job. So he wrote a letter to his superiors stating that he didn't
    want to move out of Kumbakonam, and he didn't want to get promoted. It was
    a fair deal to make - "keep me here, even if it means you don't promote
    me". When he retired, my uncle was just slightly above the rank of a
    cashier.
</p>
<p>
    My uncle is not unhappy, as far as I know. I have not known him to be
    unhappy when I lived in his house briefly during high school. His life took
    a different trajectory than my dad's, for sure. It was not marked by the
    insatiable ambition that was ever-present in my dad's life. He didn't have
    quite the same social capital as my father did over the years. He didn't
    touch the lives of as many people was my father did. But he raised a
    beautiful, happy, and well-functioning daughter who now happily lives in
    Toronto. He saved enough money for his retirement. He lived an unexciting
    but peaceful life, and he continues to live quietly and contentedly.
</p>
<p className="pb-10">
    That's not a bad life, by any stretch of the imagination.
</p>
<h4>
    So what is the best way to live?
</h4>
<p>
    Should you constantly strive and set newer and bigger goals for yourself,
    like my dad did? Or should you search for peace and try to be satisfied
    with what you have?
</p>
<p>
    After my conversation with my dad last week, I reflected on my own. I have
    come to the realization that it is an answer that everyone needs to find
    for themselves.
</p>
<p>
    I am very much my father's daughter in that. I continue to strive and push
    in my life, even if it means constantly facing the demon of
    dissatisfaction. But you can, with equal validity, choose contentment like
    my uncle did.
</p>
<p>
    Reflect on what kind of life you want to live: would you like an eventful
    life with lots of ups and downs? Or a life with less craving, less success,
    but more satisfaction? Once you find that answer in your heart of hearts,
    have courage and follow it. Do not worry about what others are doing or
    saying. Do not compare yourself with others, and do not become prey to
    FOMO. Your choice is just as good as theirs.
</p>
<p>
    As William Ernest Henley said, how wonderful it is to be the master of your fate, and the
    captain of your soul!
