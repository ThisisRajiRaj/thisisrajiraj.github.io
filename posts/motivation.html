    Have you watched the movie The Groundhog Day? In that movie, the
    protagonist Phil Conners gets caught up in a fantastical time loop,
    reliving the same miserable day over and over. He hears the same dull song
    on the radio every morning, meets the same tedious people, does the same
    uninspiring things, all the while feeling frustrated and striving badly to
    escape the loop.
</p>
<p>
    This last year, a lot of us have been feeling as Phil does in the movie. It
    has been the same thing for us too, over and over. We wake up from our
    dreary sleep, tumble into our makeshift offices in our pyjamas, with a sour
    cup of coffee from the kitchen, and drift in and out of meetings and work.
    If we have little kids at home, we attend to them, sometimes telling them
    that we are busy and they should stop bothering us, and at other times
    letting them potter into our virtual meetings. We repeat the recipes we
    cook at home or take out meals from the same handful of restaurants nearby.
    We have not gone on long vacations. We have not seen our extended families.
    Slowly, we have gone from confusion to panic to determination to boredom.
</p>
<p>
    I hear this boredom a lot in my recent conversations with folks. A lot more
people have been reaching out of late with the question, "<strong>How do you find the energy to go to work, day after day</strong>?"
</p>
<p>
    In normal times, I find that my work inherently gives me energy. The people
    I work with and what I learn from them, the new experiences I get
    introduced to, the gnarly problems I get to solve - all of these are
    sources of energy and purpose. But of course, these are not normal times.
    When energy is not there in front of you for the grabbing, you need to
    invent it. You need to intentionally do things to get excited about life
    and work, to get motivated to get up from bed every single morning.
</p>
<p>
    Here are six ways that I have found to help me do that.
</p>
<br/>
<h5>
    #1: Pursue small, concrete actions
</h5>
<p>
    I spend fifteen minutes of every morning writing in my journal. Some days
    when I am particularly feeling purposeless, I make a list of three things.
</p>
<p>
</ol>
<li>
    <b>What is the one thing I want to learn today?</b>
    <p>What I want to learn could be something relevant to my job. It could be a
    technical subject. It could be a YouTube video or a LinkedIn learning
    course in an area I have little understanding of. It could be something to
    help me with my leadership skills. It could be a new book I just picked up 
    from my e-library. But this something I learn should excite me and help me
    look forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <b>What is the one thing I want to help someone else with?</b>
    <p>
        I find that just seeing a nice note of appreciation or gratitude is a great
        help these days for folks. As I write my one thing that I want to help
        someone with, I ponder about the people that I want to thank and celebrate
        in my work or life. In our busy lives, unless we are intentional about it,
        we rush on without paying attention to the fabulous things people do.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
<b>What is the one thing I want to create or initiate today?</b>

<p>
    Creating something new always fills me with joy. Whether it is a meal I
    cook with care or an article I write or some new initiative I spur on at
    work - igniting something to life energizes me.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
    Writing this list gives me a few concrete things to focus on that can bring
    me joy. It gives me things to look forward to, things I can accomplish and
    feel good about at the end of the day.
</p>
<h5>
    #2: Chop wood, carry water
</h5>

<p>
    The Zen tradition is famous for its <em>koans </em>- little lyrical stories
    that are riddled with meaning. Here is one such story: A young Zen novice
    longs after enlightenment, <em>nirvana</em>. He wants to know what he must
    do before he attains enlightenment. He goes to the master of the temple and
    asks him.
</p>
<p>
    The master replies simply that he must chop wood and carry water.
</p>
<p>
    The novice ponders the answer and continues, "And what about after I attain
    enlightenment?". The master replies again: you must chop wood and carry
    water.
</p>
<p>
    Chop wood, carry water. That is all one needs to do. That is, one must do
    their work without intellectualizing too much. Barack Obama, in his book "A
Promised Land", talks about how he had to often remind himself that he must    <em><u>just do his job</u></em>, regardless of the frustrations and
    politics that plagued him.
</p>
<p>
    Focus on the work in front of you. Be in the present moment. Do not
    overthink it and get caught up in the emotions, expectations, and stories
    inside your head.
</p>
<h5>
    #3: Remember your energy is contagious
</h5>
<p>
    Perhaps it is too soon to use the word 'contagious', but you get the point.
    Like the shimmering beam of a lighthouse at night, you are always
    broadcasting your energy - positive or negative - to others. So, think
    about what kind of energy you are sharing and how you might be affecting
    others.
</p>
<p>
    But why should you care about others when you are feeling low? Because
    being less self-absorbed - and more service-oriented - is a path out of
    feeling rudderless. When you are feeling a lack of energy, think of your
    teammates and how they need you to pick up the oar and row along with them.
    If you are a leader, think of the people you manage. What is your
    "contract" with them? What do they expect from you? How can you hold up
    your end of the bargain and not give in to the feeling of despondency?
</p>
<h5>
    #4: Know thy work
</h5>
<p>
    There is meaning in your work, even if you do not see it immediately. If
    you are a doctor, it is easy to viscerally know your impact. You cure
    people, help ease suffering, and give hope to others. But what if you are a
    programmer, and your days are filled with debating if you should use
    TypeScript or JavaScript or if you should have a button or a link on a web
    page? What is the meaning in that work?
</p>
<p>
    My advice is to go a step deeper to understand the true purpose of your
    work. Think about who is going to use your software. How will they benefit
    from it? How delighted they would be to have your software be crafted with
    quality and attention? If it is still unclear to you how your work is
    helping the world, talk to people on your team that can help you make sense
    of it. But most importantly, strive to understand what your work is and
    whom it is for.
</p>
<h5>
    #5: Take a break
</h5>

    There is no question that the year has been tough for many of us. Fatigue
    builds on top of isolation to become a formidable wall for us to climb
    every single day. Listen to the science here and give yourself a break. I
    am a runner and I often train for long distance events. In my weekly
    training program, there are days of intense work followed by rest days when
    I give my body time to recuperate. You cannot have energy if you do not
    have periods of rest. Sleep well, take days off, take tea/coffee/walk breaks in
    the middle of days, sit with your eyes closed in between work meetings. Do
    whatever it takes to recover and reenergize.
</p>

<h5>
    #6: Reframe it as an opportunity
</h5>
<p>
    22 million jobs have been lost due to the pandemic last year. Experts
    predict that it can take over 4 years to recover these lost jobs. Financial
    pain felt across the globe has been enormous. Amidst this global crisis, if
    you have a job, what an opportunity it is for you to do something with your
    time, bring value to the world, and make money for yourself! Replace your
    internal negative talk with a positive soundtrack. Remind yourself that
    work is a wonderful opportunity for you to learn new things, serve others,
    get new experiences, and do intellectually stimulating things. Reframe the
    humdrum or the obstacles you see in the day in front of you as
    opportunities.

    So there you go: chop wood and carry water, take breaks, see your days an
    opportunity, understand your work's purpose, think of how you might be
    affecting others, and pursue small concrete actions to motivate yourself.
    These are some techniques I have used to stay sane and purposeful during
    these tough times. I hope find them useful to reclaim the energy within you
    too.
