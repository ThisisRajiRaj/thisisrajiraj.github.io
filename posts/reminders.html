<p>
    I spent the last days of 2020 in reflection and quiet work. The days
    were aimless and rainy, with dark clouds brooding over a titanium gray sky.
</p>
<p>
    I did a couple of things in those silent, languid days. I made a slide deck
    for an upcoming talk. I had been asked to give a talk on building a
    fulfilling life while also enjoying your work. What better way to
    write this talk - I thought - than to reflect on my own life and lessons. I
    opened my journal and started writing longform. I scribbled a list of
    precepts - reminders to myself, really - that I can share with my audience. 
    Some of them came from lessons from my lived experience, some from
    books I have read or talks I have watched. I hope you find them useful
    too. Here they are...

<h4>
    Choose what you care about.
</h4>
<p>
    Have you read this wonderful book 
    <a
        href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck"
    >
        "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck?"
    </a>
    Don't be fooled by it's title. The book is not an argument for utter
    thoughtlessness about *everything* in your life. There are clearly things
    that you should care about. For me - as 2020 made abundantly clear - these
    are my health, my significant relationships, and doing good work that
    matters. But by nature, I care about too many things around me, and that's
    what the book preaches against. Over the course of my life, though, I have
    learned to be choosier. I have learned to ask questions like: Does it
    really matter what my random co-worker thinks about me? Why should I care
    what my aunt thinks about my life choices?
</p>
<p>
    Choose what you spend your mental calories on - it can free your mind.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Mastery is a process, not a state.
</h4>
<p>
    Many of us are in high-octane professions or have bold goals. Our work
    typically calls for a level of excellence that we are not born with.
    Becoming great at work will take time. I have
    <a href="https://www.rajiraj.com/blog/growingpains">
        told the story of my early days
    </a>
    at Microsoft before.
    <strong>
        This process of "noticing my gaps -&gt; resolving to learn -&gt;
        learning -&gt; getting feedback" is cyclical and has been ever-present
        in my career.
    </strong>
    Whether it is coding or leadership or speaking or writing, being at peace
    with not being an instant virtuoso - and reminding myself that "this is
    good enough, <em>for now</em>" - has helped ease my mind.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Trust that you will figure it out.
</h4>
<p>
    In the summer of 2016, I decided to walk the Swiss Alps, from Chamonix to
Zermatt, along a well-known path called    <a href="https://www.rajiraj.com/blog/HauteRoute">the Haute Route</a>. It
    took me about two weeks to walk the entire 100+ miles, scaling multiple
    passes. It was one of most wondrous things I have ever done. Night skies
    strewn with a million stars, massive blue glaciers tumbled over
    mountainsides, rumbling waterfalls, forests thick with trees, and winds so
    strong they could push you down if you don't take care. The walk was also
    one of the most challenging things I have done, completely beyond my
    comfort zone.
</p>

    </figcaption>

</figure>
<br/>
<p>
    When I decided to do it, I was beset by doubts. Will I have the strength to
    climb such high mountains? Will the scrambles be too much for my wobbly
footing and frail ankles? I write about one particularly dreadful section    
<a href="https://www.rajiraj.com/blog/HauteRoute">here</a>. It was a goat
    path winding up a mountain that felt like a heap of rocks. With every step
    you took, your feet sank and slithered, and you prayed to all the gods you
    believed in and the ones you didn't believe in too. But I summited it,
    despite my self-doubts and fears. I asked for help from my husband. I
    watched where I planted my feet. I used rocks as leverage to pull myself
    up. It was slow going and nerve-wracking, but I figured it out.
</p>
<p>
    It is the same deal with work.
    <strong>
        To do big, scary things - in life or work - you need to know deep down
        that you will figure it out. Because you will.
    </strong>
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Every endeavor can teach you something. Be curious.
</h4>
<p>
    It takes little experiments and baby steps to build that trust in yourself.
    When we build software products, in my team, we experiment a lot. We make
    little hypotheses and test them out. We learn. That is how we know when to
    build on and what to alter. Likewise, think of every activity you pursue -
    every interaction you have, every meeting you attend - as a little
    experiment that can help you learn something. Not with a goal to impress or
    get everything down pat.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        One of my mentors told me once to "collect data with every
        interaction".
    </strong>
    Approach your work with that scientist-like mindset and you will find that
    you look forward to many previously frightful activities.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Do not dwell.

<p>
    In 2018, I was asked to demo a few Microsoft technologies to a packed arena
    of 20000+ IT Professionals. I had never done anything like that before, and
    I was nervous. Understandably, I wanted to nail it. My demo was 30 minutes
    long, split into two segments. I was in the middle of my second segment
    when I realized something was wrong with my demo. My prepared words were
    spilling out of my mouth, but what I expected on the screen didn't
    materialize. The product team had just deployed something that caused my
    script to become irrelevant. I stumbled.
</p>
<p>
    Even today
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C070KEL7v0I&amp;feature=youtu.be">
        when I watch the video clip of it,
    </a>
    I zoom in, within a microsecond, to where I failed. I cringe. That's how
    much I can dwell on my failures. But when I got off the stage that day,
    feeling like a child who had just dropped her ice cream cone on dirt, I
    went straight to my team to say I was sorry. I had failed them. I had
    failed the demo. But my team didn't even notice my fumble. They were
    puzzled what I was talking about. They thought everything had gone as planned.
    Not just them, but no one that watched me present that day pointed to my
    gaffe. <strong>The moral: do not dwell on your screw-ups.</strong> Sure, failures
    are important learning opportunities, but there is no use in dwelling on
    what's happened.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    You have a right to a vision and voice of your own.
</h4>
<p>
    How many times have you wanted to say something in a meeting, and you didn't? You
    either felt nervous about opening your mouth or that your perspective
was not that important.    <strong>Know that your voice is important in your workplace</strong>.
    What's more, you have a right to be there, a right to voice your
    perspective, a vision that is all your own even if it is not the most
    popular one. Here are some ways in which you will help
    <a href="https://www.rajiraj.com/blog/meetings">
        calm those meeting nerves.
    </a>
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Do your work. The outcome and people's reactions are not your concern.
</h4>
<p>
    When I was growing up, my father often told me to do my best and leave the
rest to God. I like a variation of that aphorism now:    <strong>Do your work, do not burden yourself with the outcome</strong>.
    Focusing on my work - not on how it is received or how it is going to
    succeed or fail - has helped me not just be happier but produce higher
    quality work. In fact, I do this a lot with my writing. I write because I
    enjoy writing, I have something to say, I have a right to say it, and I
    believe it will help others. What others think of what I say, whether they
    agree or not, whether it is well-received or not - these are not my
    concern.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Make time for important things.
</h4>

<br/>

    </figcaption>

</figure>
<br/>
<p>
    First, make a list of things that are important to you - work, health,
    relationships, fun. Anything else you're doing that doesn't contribute to
    what is important to you - like binge watching that show on Netflix,
    doomscrolling through Twitter, gossiping with a relative - cut it from your
    life. We often feel like we do not have time to do everything. Here is the
thing:    <strong>you don't need to do everything you're doing today. </strong>If you
    are intentional about where you're spending your time, you will magically
    mine minutes throughout the day that you can use for important things in
    your life. Mining minutes has been an important insight for me. These days,
    I don't go anywhere without my book, for example. Reading is
    important to me, and I know that I can mine minutes while I waiting on the
    parking lot or the lobby of my dentist to read. Find five minutes here, ten minutes there,
    to do the things you want to do.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Do not take yourself TOO seriously.
</h4>
<p>
    A lot of us aim for greatness and mattering a lot to a lot of people - in the present and the future. 
    Making an impact, leaving 
    a legacy, being remembered as worthy, you name it. We think that everything we do should be fabulous and great because 
    everything we do will be remembered. In aiming for such gravity and immortality, 
    we get so immobilized 
    that we don't start things now or finish things that matter to a few people today. 

    But remember the lightness of our lives and 
    the impermanence of things. That can help you break that paralysis and enjoy 
    what you do. If most things in this world are temporary, perhaps you can write your 
    silly poem and publish it too? Perhaps you can get on that stage and say a few 
    words no matter how little prepared you are? Perhaps you can be goofy and have 
    a bit of fun?
</p>

<h4>
    It's ok to be imperfect. It makes you human.

    A very good friend of mine, who is a master storyteller, finishes her
    slides the morning of her talk. She hates rehearsing. I, on the other hand,
    obsess over what I have to say and how I say it. I come from a long line of
    people who didn't like to "get laughed at" by their neighbors and family,
    so aiming for perfection is as easy as mixing salt and water for me. It is
    not just me, though. Many luminaries that I admire - from Melinda Gates to
    Angela Merkel to Michelle Obama - are famous over-preparers. Christine
    LaGarde, the president of European Central Bank once said this about her
    preparation.

                to be completely on top of everything, and we want to understand it all,

    I have nothing against preparation. I continue to be someone who likes to
    prepare, especially for important meetings and events. But I also know that
    overpreparing can kill your ability to think on your feet. More
    importantly, it can make you anxious and lose valuable time. In the world of software development,
    we say that <em>Done is better than perfect</em>. It is true for life too.
    Remember that you are only human, and people know that. Most people are not
    expecting perfection from you. And no one is intently watching *everything* you say
    and do. We are all too caught up in our own lives for that.
</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>
    As we leave 2020 behind, and start a fresh new year, take a moment
    to think about the principles, the guardrails, the rules that can propel you forward.
    Then write them down as a list of reminders for yourself. Tell me, what does your list look like?
