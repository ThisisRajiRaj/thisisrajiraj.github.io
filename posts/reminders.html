    People call them by many names: principles, mantras, rules, mottos. Truisms to act as guardrails 
    when you are beginning something new or to give you clarity when your mind feels clouded. 
</p>
<p>
    In the end days of 2020, I wrote a list of such things in my journal. They were 
    reminders to help me lead a fulfilling life 
    while doing good work that I enjoy. 

        A lot of these came from my life. Some came from books I have read and talks I have 
    listened to. While they were reminders I wrote for myself, I think they can be useful to you too, 
    so I wanted to share them here with you.
</p>
<p>
    Here they are...

<h4>
    1. Choose what you care about.
</h4>
<p>
    Have you read this wonderful book 
    <a
        href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck"
    >
        "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck?"
    </a>
    Don't be fooled by it's title. The book is not an argument for utter
    thoughtlessness about *everything* in your life. There are undoubtedly things
    that you should care about. For me - as 2020 made abundantly clear - these
    are my health, my significant relationships, and doing good work that
    matters. But, by nature, I care about too many things around me, and that's
    what the book preaches against. 
</p>
<p>
    Over the course of my life, though, I have
    learned to be choosier. I have learned to ask questions like: Does it
    really matter if a random co-worker doesn't like me? Why should I care
    what my aunt thinks about my life choices? Choose what you spend your mental calories on - it can free your mind.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    2. Mastery is a process, not a state.
</h4>
<p>
    Many of us are in high-octane professions or have bold goals. Our work
    typically calls for a level of excellence that we are not born with.
    Becoming great at work will take time. I have
    <a href="https://www.rajiraj.com/blog/growingpains">
        told the story of my early days
    </a>
    at Microsoft before.
    <strong>
        This process of "noticing my gaps -&gt; 
        learning -&gt; getting feedback" is cyclical and has been ever-present
        in my career.
    </strong>
    Whether it is coding or leadership or speaking or writing, being at peace
    with not being an instant virtuoso has helped ease my mind.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    3. Trust that you will figure it out.
</h4>
<p>
    In the summer of 2016, I decided to walk the Swiss Alps, from Chamonix to
Zermatt, along a well-known path called    <a href="https://www.rajiraj.com/blog/HauteRoute">the Haute Route</a>. It
    took me about two weeks to walk the entire 100+ miles, scaling multiple
    passes. 

</p>
<p>

It was one of most wondrous things I have ever done. Night skies
    strewn with a million stars, massive blue glaciers tumbled over
    mountainsides, rumbling waterfalls, forests thick with trees, and winds so
    strong they could push you down if you don't take care. The walk was also
    one of the most challenging things I have done, completely beyond my
    comfort zone.
</p>

    </figcaption>

</figure>
<br/>
<p>
    When I decided to do it, I was beset by doubts. I wrote about one particularly dreadful section    
<a href="https://www.rajiraj.com/blog/HauteRoute">here</a>. It was a goat
    path winding up a mountain that felt like a heap of rocks. With every step
    I took, my feet sank and slithered. But I did it,
    despite my self-doubts and fears. I
    watched where I planted my feet. I used rocks as leverage to pull myself
    up. It was slow going and nerve-wracking, but I figured it out.
</p>
<p>
    It is the same deal with work.
    <strong>
        To do big, scary things - in life or work - you need to know deep down
        that you will figure it out. Because you will.
    </strong>
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    4. Every endeavor can teach you something. Be curious.
</h4>
<p>
    It takes little experiments and baby steps to build that trust in yourself.
    When we build software products, in my team, we experiment a lot. We make
    little hypotheses and test them out. We learn. That is how we know when to
    build on and what to alter. Likewise, think of every activity you pursue -
    every interaction you have, every meeting you attend - as a little
    experiment that can help you learn something.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        One of my mentors told me once to "collect data with every
        interaction".
    </strong>
    Approach your work with that scientist-like mindset and you will find that
    you look forward to many previously frightful activities.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    5. Do not dwell.
</h4>

<br/>

<br/>
<p>
    In 2018, I was asked to demo a few Microsoft technologies to a packed arena
    of 20000+ IT Professionals. I had never done anything like that before, and
    understandably, I was nervous. My demo was 30 minutes
    long, split into two segments. I was in the middle of my second segment
    when I realized something was wrong with my demo. My prepared words were
    spilling out of my mouth, but what I expected on the screen didn't
    materialize. The product team had just deployed something that caused my
    script to become irrelevant. I stumbled.
</p>
<p>
    Even today
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C070KEL7v0I&amp;feature=youtu.be">
        when I watch the video clip of it,
    </a>
    I zero in on the part where I failed. But when I got off the stage that day,
    feeling like a child who had just dropped her ice cream cone on dirt, I
    went straight to my team to say I was sorry. I had failed them. I had
    failed the demo. But my team didn't even notice my fumble. They thought everything had gone as planned. <strong>The moral: do not dwell on your screw-ups.</strong> Sure, failures
    are important learning opportunities, but there is no use in dwelling on
    what's happened. Besides, no one is intently watching *everything* you say
    and do. We are all too caught up in our own lives for that.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    6. Do your work. The outcome and people's reactions are not your concern.
</h4>
<p>
    When I was growing up, my father often told me to do my best and leave the
rest to God. I like a variation of that aphorism now:    <strong>Do your work, do not burden yourself with the outcome</strong>.
    Focusing on my work - not on how it is received or how it is going to
    succeed or fail - has helped me not just be happier but produce higher
    quality work too. In fact, I do this a lot with my writing. I write because I
    enjoy writing, I have something to say, I have a right to say it, and I
    believe it will help others. What others think of what I say, whether they
    agree or not, whether it is well-received or not - these are not my
    concern.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    7. Make time for important things.
</h4>

<br/>
<figure>
    <img src="https://thisisrajiraj.github.io/posts/images/multipleinterests.jpg"/>
    <figcaption style="text-align:center">
    <small>I love traveling, reading, writing, building tech, running, being with my family...</small>
    </figcaption>

</figure>
<br/>
<p>
    First, make a list of things that are important to you - work, health,
    relationships, fun. Anything else you're doing that doesn't contribute to
    what is important to you - like binge watching that show on Netflix,
    doomscrolling through Twitter, gossiping with a relative - cut it from your
    life. We often feel like we do not have time to do everything. Here is the
thing:    <strong>you don't need to do everything you're doing today. </strong>If you
    are intentional about where you're spending your time, you will magically
    mine minutes throughout the day that you can use for important things in
    your life. 

</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    8. It's ok to be imperfect. It makes you human.
</h4>

<br/>
<p>
    A very good friend of mine, who is a master storyteller, makes her
    slides the morning of her talk. She hates rehearsing. I, on the other hand, 
can overthink what I say and how I say it. I come from a long line of
    people who didn't like to "get laughed at" by their neighbors and family,
    so aiming for perfection is as easy as mixing salt and water for me. It is
    not just me, though. Many luminaries that I admire - from Melinda Gates to
    Angela Merkel to Michelle Obama - are famous over-preparers. Christine
    LaGarde, the president of European Central Bank once said this about her
    preparation.

                When we work on a particular matter, we will work the file inside, outside,
                sideways, backwards, historically, genetically, and geographically. We want
                to be completely on top of everything, and we want to understand it all,
                and we don't want to be fooled by somebody else.

<p>
    I have nothing against preparation. I continue to be someone who likes to
    prepare, especially for important meetings and events. But I also know that
    overpreparing can kill your ability to think on your feet. More
    importantly, it can make you anxious and lose valuable time. In the world of software development,
    we say that <em>Done is better than perfect</em>. It is true for life too.
    Remember that you are only human, and people know that. Most people are not
    expecting perfection from you. 
</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>
   So those are some of the things I intend to remind myself of often. 
The last days of 2020 were aimless and rainy where I live, dark clouds brooding over a titanium gray sky.
   As we left 2020 behind to start a fresh new year, it was the ideal moment
    to reflect on these important lessons. I think it can be 
    mighty helpful for 
    you to make a list of your own too - reflect on <u>your</u> experiences and tendencies you want to keep at bay, and 
    write reminders for yourself. All you need are a notebook, a pen, and some quiet time.
</p>
<p>
    Will you do it?
