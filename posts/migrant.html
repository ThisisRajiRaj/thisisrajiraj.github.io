    <b>M</b>y husband lived in the same house, with the same three people, for the
    first twenty years of his life. He went to the same school from
    kindergarten until college. His early years were filled with love. His
    mom worked as a teacher, a job that made her feet hurt and her voice hoarse
    at the end of long days. Despite that, she religiously woke up at 5 AM
    everyday to pack fresh, home-cooked lunches for her kids. My husband spent
    afternoons with aunts that coddled him. He visited his uncle on the
    weekends. His uncle took him and his cousins to the beach, buying them ice
    cream cones or slices of green mango, sprinkled with chili and salt. My
    husband's family was his rock, his foundation. 
</p>
<p>
    For me, it was something altogether different. I lived in seven different
    houses with six different families for the first twenty years of my life.
    My friend Nancy, a self-described army brat, tells me it was no different
    for her. She moved around as a child too, her father getting posted in
    different bases around the country, from Oregon to California to Alaska to
    Hawaii. My father was not in the military, but I moved around thanks to the
    biggest accident of my life - the accident of losing my mother when I was
    five.

    <b>T</b>he first house I lived in was our ancestral home in a tiny, quiet town
    called Kumbakonam. The house, typical of traditional houses in that region,
    was deeper than it was wide. You could start walking from the entrance, in
    a straight line for ten minutes, deeper and deeper into the bowels of
    the house, until you reached the lush backyard, thick with shrubs and coconut
    and mango trees. It had multiple open courtyards, a dank kitchen with a
    wood burning stove and stone grinding equipment. It had a large indoor
    swing made of wooden plank and iron chains, the swing on which my mother
    drew her last breath. It had a dark bedroom with a small window from which
    I glimpsed my mother's last journey to the crematorium. I lived in this
    house for the first five years of my life. After my mother died, I moved to
    my next house.
</p>
<p>
    My next house, where I lived with my grandma and my father, was a flat on
    the third floor of a building in Chennai. I remember few things about this
    house. There was an Asoka tree outside the window to our bedroom, where a
    sparrow had meticulously built a nest out of twigs and cotton. There was a
    community garbage heap nearby that reeked of rotten fruits and excrement. My
    grandmother was a no-nonsense woman and an indefatigable task master. She
    expected a lot of out of herself and a lot out of me. She wanted to raise
    me - a motherless child who was suddenly her responsibility - into a
    charming wife and a dutiful daughter-in-law. I would grow up to admire my
    grandma's strong will and sheer strength, but we were constantly at odds.
    She wanted me to learn to clean the house and fold the laundry. I - strangely
    for a child, but not too strangely for a rebellious child - wanted to study
    instead. 
</p>
<p>I remember this time in my life as one of constant haranguing from
    my grandma and constant resentment on my part. Once I complained to an aunt
    of mine that was visiting us that my grandma would not buy me shampoo -
    shampoo being too "western" for her. I protested that my hair dripped with 
    oil and smelled. I was embarrassed at school. My aunt stuffed a hundred
    rupees note into the palm of my hand and told me to buy myself some
    satchels of shampoo. It was important - she insisted - that I learn to
    quietly solve my own problems. It was no good just fighting the same fight
    every day and expecting a different result. This became an important lesson
    for me that would stay useful into my adult life. <strong>
        Speak up, find creative solutions to problems. Most importantly, become
        self-reliant.
    </strong>

    <b>M</b>y dad began to suspect that all was not okay between me and grandma. He
    argued also that I needed the care of a younger, more modern woman - a
    mother figure. My mother's sister agreed to take me in. Her house, back in
    Kumbakonam, was built with ancient stones, had low ceilings and little
    alcoves for oil lamps. The routines in this house were so different from
    what I had become used to in bustling Chennai. Unlike my grandma, the
    womenfolk here were never rushed. They treated themselves to long afternoon
    naps every day. At school too, everything was different. New uniforms, new
    teachers, a new syllabus, new rules, and most importantly new classmates. I
    learned that, at home and at school, I had to watch and learn constantly.
    Everyone was different, and every family had a dozen unspoken rules. I had
to understand what made up this new world, and how I could be ok within it.    <strong>Watch, learn, adapt.</strong> Another life lesson I would carry
    with me into my adult life, when I became an immigrant in two countries and
    a leader in a field filled with people that didn't look like me.
</p>

<p>
After two years, I moved again. I do not fully grasp the reasons for this
    move or the three that followed it, but I know that my dad always had good
    reasons in his mind. He was a single dad struggling to raise two kids with
    little help. And of course, I was not an easy child for relatives to care
    for. While I could swiftly adapt to new surroundings, I had a mind that
    buzzed like a beehive, always looking for mischief or trouble. I also had a
    mouth on me. I remember constantly quibbling with folks, arguing stridently
    as though I was speaking at a civil rights gathering. So, off I went, from
    one home to another, packing up my few things and saying goodbyes to the
    few kids that were just beginning to become friends.
</p>
<p>
    I sometimes wonder how my life would have been if I had had more stability
    in my childhood. Would I have found it easier to be a good student? Would I
    have been happier? I don't know. Growing up, I envied my brother because he
    got to stay with my dad, while I was thrown around like a hot potato. But
    in hindsight, my fragmented childhood made me who I am today. I was reading
    Michelle Obama's book <em>Becoming</em> recently, and this quote caught my
    attention.

<b>M</b>y story is what I have. It is a story of separations, losses, and strife.
    It is a story that made me fear being abandoned, fear not being loved, and
    - paradoxically - gave me an unusual level of detachment from family.
    Moving around so much and the constant learning were exhausting. But it also
    taught me agility, comfort with change, resilience, and the courage to
    stand up for myself. Until recently, I could not point to any single house
    and call it home. Unlike my husband, I could not call a city or town "my
    hometown". I was from everywhere and from nowhere. While I now have a home
    that I have lived in for 14 years, I still feel untethered to places and
    objects. My story is not a pretty story, but it is not an ugly one either.
    It is simply a story that made me.
