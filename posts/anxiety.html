title: What I learned from my quest for well-being
date: June 03, 2021
---
<p>
    These last few months have felt like a slog. News from India - where my
    father and my mother-in-law and many dear aunts, uncles, and cousins live -
    has been agonizing. I have woken up in the middle of nights, unable to fall
    back asleep, tossing and turning, thinking about all the different ways
    things could go bad. What if my father becomes sick and cannot recover? How
    can I go home and take care of him? Who will take my frail
    mother-in-law who lives alone to the vaccination center? In fact, where can
    she find a vaccine? Will my aunt, who is in the ICU, survive? Did I make a
    mistake moving thousands of miles of away from so many of my loved ones?
</p>
<p>
    My mind would often fill with these dark anxieties - like heavy clouds.
    When these thoughts entered my head, they would circle incessantly,
    gathering mass, making my head hurt, my heart beat fast, and my entire body
    fill with a warm sense of dread. I would have to intentionally redirect my 
    focus onto my work, reminding myself that I should find a way to function
    despite these disabling fears and worries.
</p>
<p>
    These few months - with a pandemic raging globally - have been riddled with
    such moments of anxiety. But moments of anxiety are not alien to anyone who
    works in any high-octane profession. There are many things that can cause
    anxiety at work: high expectations on oneself, fear of looking bad, a false
    belief that people are constantly judging you, a tendency to catastrophize
    missteps….the list goes on.
</p>
<p>
    I have a habit of turning to books and classes whenever I have a
    particularly tough challenge that I need information on. Over the last
    month, I have been reading many books and attending courses that teach me
    about mental health, self-care, and well-being. Here are some that I have read or watched or
    listened to.

</p>
<p>
    The first thing I realized from all this learning is
    <strong>
        how much my well-being depends on the state of my mind. 
    </strong>
    Psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky says that our happiness depends 50% on our
    genes (everyone starts off at a genetic happiness setpoint that makes us
    more, or less, happy), 10% on our life circumstances, and 40% on our
    thoughts, behaviors, and actions. The last 40% is what we have most control
    over. John Milton was right when he said that the mind can make a hell out
    of heaven or vice versa.
</p>
<p>
One way our mind does that is by incessantly wandering.    <strong>We flit away from reality frequently. </strong>Studies have found
    that people spend close to 50% of their waking hours thinking about
    something other than what they are working on. I may be sitting here,
    listening to my husband saying something about his day, all the while
    living in a different place or time. Whether we are working or vegetating
    in front of our TV or meditating, our mind wanders a lot.
</p>
<p>
    "A human mind is a wandering mind, and a wandering mind is an unhappy
    mind." - Daniel Gilbert
</p>
<p>
    To gain better mental health, we need to learn to focus our wandering mind.
</p>
<p>
    When our minds wander, and especially during stressful times, we usually
    think about three things that take us away from the reality of the present
    moment.
</p>
<p>
    1- The Past
</p>
<p>
    2- The Future
</p>
<p>
    3- The Others
</p>
<h5>
    The past
</h5>
<p>
    Thinking about the past is classic rumination. We play a movie in our head
    that feels like a replay of a past event. We get ourselves caught in
    nostalgia or some past glory. We go over something in great detail, picking
    apart interactions self-consciously, mentally reviewing everything we did
    and didn't do. Most insidiously, we agonize over past failures and
    screw-ups, feeling pangs of regret.
</p>
<p>
    One tool I learned in all my recent learning is using the word "Stop!" to
    end my vortex of brooding.
    <strong>
        When I become aware of my getting lost in the forest of my past, I
        close my eyes and say to myself "Stop!".
    </strong>
    I then imagine letting the thought go before bringing back attention to
    whatever I am doing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Remember that the past - like the future - is a figment that your brain
        constructs out of your memory. 
    </strong>
    It is no longer real. Living in the past is like making a nest out of a
    cobweb. The only substantial and guaranteed reality is the present moment.
</p>
<h5>
    The future.
</h5>
<p>
    If my mind is not dwelling on the past, it ceaselessly computes the future.
    How would I feel if this happens and then this happens and then this? How
    should I react? How should I protect myself and everything I love?
</p>
<p>
    In the book "Freeing yourself from Anxiety", the author gives some very
good advice to deal with this. She recommends    <strong>distancing yourself from your ominous inner voice</strong> that is
    doing the predicting. For example, you can name your inner voice "The
    calculator man/woman", the one who always calculates your future. When you
    start hearing that voice, you can tell yourself "Oh, the calculator man is
    here" and not get caught in the net of your thoughts.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Humans are perhaps the only animals that have the cognitive capacity to
    imagine our futures. Imagining our futures can be wonderful. It can help us
    create better lives for ourselves, give us hope to escape crushing
    situations, help us build a better world. But it can also hamper us by
    inaccurately warning us of calamities ahead. One reminder that I find
    valuable is this: <strong>no one really knows the future</strong>. The
    future is full of possibilities and options and forks in the road that lead
    to different unknowable places.
</p>
<p>
    The thought of future that colonizes our mind, however, is a figment of the
    imagination. It is not real yet. Our imagined futures are shaped
    predominantly by our past experiences. Martin Seligman, the father of
    Positive Psychology, talks about different explanatory styles humans have
    and how they affect how hopeful our constructed future is. If one explains
    their past negative events as "temporary setbacks that affect a small area
    of your life and that are caused by circumstances", they are bound to be
    more optimistic.<strong> </strong>If they explain them as "permanent,
    pervading your whole life, and caused by a personal flaw", they are bound
    to create a hopeless future.
    <strong>
        Dispute the explanations that naturally surface in your head. Turn them
        from pessimistic to optimistic.
    </strong>
    Remember that you can ford the stream if and when you get there. There is
    no use in worrying about it now.
</p>
<p>
    You can also<strong> rate your threat level at the moment</strong>. A large
    bear charging at you is threat level 10, you lounging on your bed watching
    TV is a threat level of 0. What threat level is your anxiety pointing to?
</p>
<h5>
    Lastly, others
</h5>
<p>
    We are social animals, and so a lot of our anxieties reference others. What
    did my co-worker think of my work? Did my sister-in-law think my skills as
    a hostess were good? What will happen to our friendship my friend thinks I
    am not successful? Sometimes we compare too. Did he get some recognition
    that I'd rather that I got? Did her books sell more copies than mine?
</p>
<p>
    One way to counter this brooding about others is to remember your own
    blessings. The course <em>The Science of Well-being </em>
    <strong>
        recommends keeping a gratitude journal where you list 5 things you are
        grateful for every week. 
    </strong>
    I have started doing this myself and the exercise gives me great joy. In
    my journal, I have so far listed: waking up without any aches in my body,
    having a job that gives me the freedom to go for a run in the middle of the
    day, the cloudless blue sky that takes me out of myself, my father, my
    team, the warmth of my teacup, the trilling chickadee on the tree in my
    backyard….
</p>
<p>
    Another thing to remember when countering others-centered rumination is
what Nick Epley writes about in his book:    <strong>you are likely wrong with your mind-reading of others</strong>.
    Others are not thinking about you as much as you think about yourself, your
    conclusions about their perspectives could be way off the mark, and there
    is a lot more commonalities between humans than the differences we tend to
    imagine.
</p>
<p>
    Stress is as commonplace as cheap dinner plates. But in these times when a
    pandemic is plaguing the world, stress has taken our many of our lives. As
    a mentor recently reminded me, the best thing I can do now is to put on
    oxygen mask first. Self-care and mental health are something we often
    neglect in our busy lives. I have realized there can be nothing more
    important than get ourselves in functioning order first. I read uplifting
    books, go on nature walks, meditate every day, remember to breath deep, and
    strive to keep my baselines stress low. What are you doing for your mental
    health?
