title: My quest for well-being
date: June 03, 2021

<p>
    These last few months have felt like a slog. News from India - where much of my family live -
    has been agonizing. I have woken up in the middle of nights, unable to fall
    back asleep, tossing and turning, thinking about all the different ways
    things could go bad. What if my father becomes sick and cannot recover? How
    can I go home and take care of him? Who will take my frail
    mother-in-law who lives alone to the vaccination center? In fact, where can
    she find a vaccine? Will my aunt, who is in the ICU, survive? Did I make a
    mistake moving thousands of miles of away from so many of my loved ones?
</p>
<p>
    My mind would often fill with these dark anxieties - like heavy clouds.
    When these thoughts entered my head, they would circle incessantly,
    gathering mass, making my head hurt, my heart beat fast, and my entire body
    fill with a warm sense of dread. 
</p>
<p>
    I have a habit of turning to books and classes whenever I have a
    particularly tough challenge that I need information on. Over the last
    month, I have been reading many books and attending courses that teach me
    about mental health, self-care, and well-being. Here are some that I have read or watched or
    listened to.

    The first thing I realized from all this learning is
    <strong>
        how much my well-being depends on the state of my mind. 
    </strong>
    Psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky says that our happiness depends 50% on our
    genes (everyone starts off at a genetic happiness setpoint that makes us
    more, or less, happy), 10% on our life circumstances, and 40% on our
    thoughts, behaviors, and actions. The last 40% is what we have most control
    over. 
</p>
<p>
    John Milton was right when he said that the mind can make a hell out
    of heaven or heaven out of hell. One way our mind does that is by incessantly wandering.    <strong>We flit away from reality frequently. </strong>Studies have found
    that people spend close to 50% of their waking hours thinking about
    something other than what they are working on. I may be sitting here,
    listening to my husband saying something about his day, all the while
    living in a different place and a different time. Whether we are working or vegetating
    in front of our TV or meditating, our mind wanders a lot.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "A human mind is a wandering mind, and a wandering mind is an unhappy
                mind." - Daniel Gilbert
            </p>

<p>
    To gain better mental health, we need to learn how to focus our wandering mind.
</p>
<p>
    When our minds wander, and especially during stressful times, we usually
    think about three things that take us away from the reality of the present
    moment.
</p>
<p>
    1- The Past
</p>
<p>
    2- The Future
</p>
<p>
    3- Others
</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    The past
</h5>
<p>
    Thinking about the past is classic rumination. We play a movie in our head
    that feels like a replay of a past event. We go over something in great detail, picking
    apart interactions self-consciously, mentally reviewing everything we did
    or didn't do. Most insidiously, we agonize over past failures and
    screw-ups, feeling pangs of regret.
</p>
<p>
    One tool I learned in all my recent learning is using the word "Stop!" to
    end my vortex of brooding.
    <strong>
        When I become aware of my getting lost in the forest of my past, I
        close my eyes and say to myself "Stop!".
    </strong>
    I then imagine letting go of the thought before bringing back attention to
    whatever I am doing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Remember that the past - like the future - is a figment that your brain
        constructs out of your memory. 
    </strong>
    It is no longer real. Living in the past is like making a nest out of a
    cobweb. The only reality available to you is the present moment.
</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    The future
</h5>
<p>
    If my mind is not dwelling on the past, it ceaselessly computes the future.
    How would I feel if this happens and then this and then this? How
    should I react and weatherproof?
</p>
<p>
    Humans are perhaps the only animals that have the cognitive capacity to
    imagine our futures. Imagining our futures can be wonderful. It can help us
    create better lives for ourselves, give us hope to escape crushing
    situations, help us build a better world. But it can also hamper us by
    inaccurately warning us of calamities ahead. One reminder that I find
    valuable is this: <strong>no one really knows the future</strong>. The
    future is full of possibilities and options and forks in the road that lead
    to different unknowable places.
</p>
<p>
    Thoughts about the future, however, are a figment of the
    imagination. Our imagined futures are shaped
    predominantly by our past experiences. Martin Seligman, the father of
    Positive Psychology, talks about different explanatory styles humans have,
    and how they shape our mentally constructed futures. If one explains
    her past negative events as "temporary setbacks that affect a small area
    of her life and are caused by circumstances", she is bound to be
    more optimistic. If instead she explains them as "permanent failures,
    pervading her whole life, and caused by a personal flaw", she is bound
    to create a hopeless future.
    <strong>
        Dispute the explanations that naturally surface in your head. Turn them
        from pessimistic to optimistic.
    </strong>
    Remember that you can ford the stream when you get there. There is
    no use in worrying about it now.

<p>
    You can also<strong> rate your threat level at the moment</strong>. A large
    bear charging at you is a threat level of 10, you lounging on your bed watching
    TV is a threat level of 0. What threat level is your anxiety pointing to? 
    <p>
        The author of the book "Freeing yourself from Anxiety" recommends    
        <strong>distancing yourself from your ominous inner voice</strong>. 
        For example, you can name that inner voice that constantly 
        calculates the various scenarios of the future "The
        calculator man/woman". When you
        start hearing that voice in your head, you can tell yourself "Oh, the calculator man is
        here" and not get caught in the net of your thoughts.<strong></strong>
    </p>

</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    Others
</h5>
<p>
    We are social animals, and so a lot of our anxieties reference others. What
    did my co-worker think of my work? Did my sister-in-law think my skills as
    a hostess were good? Did he get some recognition
    that I'd rather that I got? 
</p>
<p>
    One way to counter this brooding about others is to remember your own
    blessings. The course <em>The Science of Well-being </em>
    <strong>
        recommends keeping a gratitude journal where you list 5 things you are
        grateful for every week. 
    </strong>
    I have started doing this myself and the exercise gives me great joy. In
    my journal, I have so far listed: waking up without any aches in my body,
    having a job that gives me the freedom to go for a run in the middle of the
    day, the cloudless blue sky that takes me out of myself, my father, my
    team, the warmth of my teacup, the trilling chickadee on the tree in my
    backyard….
</p>
<p>
    It is also helpful to remember 
what Nick Epley writes about in his book:    <strong>you are likely wrong when you mind-read others</strong>.
    Others are not thinking about you as much as you think about yourself, your
    conclusions about their perspectives could be way off the mark, and there
    is a lot more commonalities between humans than the differences we tend to
    imagine.
</p>
<br/>

<p>
    These few months - with a pandemic raging globally - have been riddled with
    many moments of anxiety. But moments of anxiety are not alien to anyone who
    works in any high-octane profession. High expectations on oneself, too many things to do, 
    fear of looking bad, a tendency to catastrophize
    missteps - all of these can cause anxiety.  Stress is as commonplace as cheap dinner plates. 
</p>
<p>
   We often neglect self-care and mental health in our busy lives. As a mentor recently reminded me, the best thing one can do now is to put on
   their own oxygen mask first.  
    To do so, I read uplifting
    books, go on nature walks, meditate every day, remember to breath deep often, connect with my family, and
    strive to keep my baseline stress low. What are you doing for your mental
    health?
