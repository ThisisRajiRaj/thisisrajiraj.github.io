    One of my earliest memories is of my dad holding me in his arms, his
    face unshaven and grimy, as we stood darkly in the foyer of our house,
    waiting for my mother's body to be cleaned and dressed for her
    funeral. My dad had just lost his wife. He was 37 or so and she was
    the love of his life. Her death was unexpected and he was left with
    two little kids to care for.
    <br />
    <br />
    &#8203;Dad remained unmarried after mom died. He had to make a number
    of tough decisions regarding me and my brother. Not all of them were
    perfect and many of them didn't result in the best outcomes. But still
    he made them and life as a single dad couldn't have been easy.&nbsp;My
    dad became my first and biggest role model. I fashioned a lot of my
    own personality after his.

    A distance of 8000+ miles separates us today.&nbsp;As I think of my
    dad on this Father's day, I think of the lessons I learned from him.
    The lessons I carry within me every day. Here are three of them.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Learning is invaluable to bettering yourself</strong>. You
    cannot put a price on education. Growing up, we were&nbsp;not
    affluent. We used to&nbsp;live&nbsp;in cramped, dusty apartments
    and&nbsp;spent money with great care. I remember how grandma used to
    write out lists of monthly expenses to be paid by my dad. Milk,
    vegetables, groceries, tuition, gas, tailoring and so on. Every single
    item on the list was scrutinized and everything needed to be
    justified. Everything except anything do with my or my brother's
    education. Dad was liberal in spending for our books, notebooks,
    erasers, pencils, and binders. If I needed to learn something, I just
    had to ask. It didn't matter how much it cost. Dad would find the
    money for it. Today I have a deep love for&nbsp;learning, and like
    him,&nbsp;I believe strongly that there are few things as valuable as
    education.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Go after what you want with courage</strong>. Do not shut down
    an option for the wrong reasons. Dad impressed on us the importance of
    not giving up on any solution to a problem without due diligence
    applied to it. I remember times when I would be ready to shut an
    option down because it involved working up the courage to ask someone
    something, or I lacked the confidence in seeing it through. What is
    the worst that could happen if you pursue it, he would ask. You ask
    for something and someone might say no. You try something and it might
    not succeed. So what? Just brush it off, and move on to the next
    option.&nbsp;He wanted me to not fear rejection or failure.&nbsp;
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Set your sights high</strong>. Dad came from humble
    beginnings. His family had lost most of what they had early on. He
    started in State Bank of India as a bank teller, and with steadfast
    work, he rose to a very high position in the bank. Dad taught us that
    one should should always aim high in life.&nbsp;Not just be a good
    student, but be a brilliant student. Not just be an engineer, but be
    an astonishingly good engineer. Not just be a good human, but be one
    of the most productive and valuable humans. And once you reach that
    point of excellence that makes you happy, don't stop. Strive to become
    even better.​&nbsp;

    My father is not a perfect man. Far from it. We mercilessly rib each
    other about our imperfections, and that is actually the fun part of
    our relationship. But I am fortunate to call him my dad.

    Happy Father's day to all the AMAZING fathers like my own!
